"
ADDITIONAL - HOME HAZARD INTERVENTIONS,"INTERVENTIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

Move the furniture so your path is clear.

Remove throw rugs or use double-sided tape or a non-slip backing so the rugs won’t slip.

Pick up any objects that are on the floor.

Coil or tape cords and wires next to the wall so you can’t trip over them. If needed, have an electrician put in another outlet.

Use non-slip or non-skid floor wax or none at all. If you have hardwood floors, consider carpet.

Replace burned-out or dim bulbs with the highest wattage bulbs allowed for each fixture in all rooms and stairways.

Replace non-working flashlights. Put several flashlights throughout your house and check the batteries regularly.

Keep a phone on a low table within reach of the floor.

Pick up any items that are on the stairs.

Fix loose, broken, or uneven steps.

Have an electrician put in an overhead light at the top and bottom of the stairs.

Make sure the carpet is firmly attached to every step, or remove the carpet and attach non-slip rubber treads to the stairs.

Fix loose handrails or put up new Ones, making sure handrails are on both sides of the stairs and are as long as the stairs.

Move items so that the things you use most often are on shelves at about waist level.

• If you must use a step stool, get one with a bar to hold on to. Never use a chair as a step stool.

Put a non-slip rubber mat or self-stick strips on the floor of the tub or shower.

Install grab bars inside the tub and next to the toilet.

Add a night light to aide seeing where you’re walking. (Some night lights go on by themselves after dark.)

"
ADDITIONAL SCREENING -  COGNITION DECLINE FOR FALL PREVENTION,"The connections between cognition and patient falls have been postulated to be related to some of the following items:

   * decline of motor function is part of the dementia process which increases with duration of the illness
   * loss of higher-level cognitive functions, particularly executive function contributing to the increased fall risk
   * dual-task performances weaken postural control even in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease
   * gait speed is impacted by either accelerating or deceleration
   * stride length variability, extra pyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor, rigidity) and contractures affect mobility in a negative manner in advanced stages of cognitive impairment

Conducted the following screening for Cognition Decline and Fall Prevention:

1. Instructed the patient to listen carefully and repeat the following
APPLE 
WATCH 
PENNY
MANZANA
RELOJ 
PESETA
2. Administer the Clock Drawing Test [CDT] (e.g. draw hands of the clock to represent the time “forty five minutes past ten o’clock” on an empty circle)
3. Ask the patient to repeat the three words given previously
_________ _________ __________
Mini cog Scoring
Number of correct items recalled _______ [if 3 then negative screen. STOP]
If answer is 1-2
Is CDT Abnormal? No Yes
If No, then negative screen
If Yes, then screen positive for cognitive impairment
If screen is positive based on Mini-cog, follow up should be done with the patient’s primary care provider for additional workup and diagnosis as appropriate.
Actions which can be taken once patients have been found to be at risk due to cognitive decline:
• additional sensitivity and vigilance to gait patterns and fall risk patterns
• engage in activities which improve cognitive function with patient and include family members as a means of instructing them
• provide instruction on behavioral management to decrease chances of falls from emotional outbursts or behavioral problems
"
ADDITIONAL SCREENING - MEDICATION CLASSES WITH RISK S FOR FALLS,"The table below is an excellent summary of the common medications which can increase the risk of falls and should be examined thoroughly when completing the medication reconciliation process.

Anti-arrhythmic drugs  (type IA†) 

Anti-convulsants †

Anti-depressants † ‡
  
Anti-histamines § 

Anti-hypertensives 

Anti-Parkinson drugs

Anti-psychotics †

Benzodiazepines †

Corticosteroids 

Digoxin †

Histamine H2-receptor blockers

Hypoglycemics
 
Muscle relaxants

Narcotic analgesics   

Nitrates

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 


† Published research suggests an association between the use of this drug or drug class and an increased risk of falling.

‡ Includes selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

§ Especially sedating antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine HCl  (e.g., Benadryl®, Pfizer) and hydroxyzine (e.g.,Atarax®, Pfizer).
  
* Not all drugs and drug classes listed have been associated with falls in published research. Therefore, this list should be used in the context of a comprehensive clinical assessment for each individual patient.

ADDITIONAL RISK ASSESSMENTS
Elderly patients (= 65 years of age) have altered pharmacokinetics & may be more “sensitive” to medications.
Renal function impairment may result in medication accumulation & increased risk of adverse reactions.
Patients taking = 4 prescription drugs, regardless of pharmacologic classification, are at an increased risk for falls.
Anticoagulants/Antiplatelets may directly increase the risk of injury from falls due to an increased bleeding risk.
Patients with untreated osteoporosis, urinary incontinence, delirium, &/or pain may have an increased risk of injury from falls.
"

TEACHING DIASEASE (Celiac Disease).,"DEFINE CELIAC DISEASE AND RISK FACTORS:
It is a disease that makes the body no able to tolerate a protein called gluten. Gluten is found in wheat, rye, and barley. Gluten can also be found in the products we use, such as stamps, envelopes, some medicines, and some vitamins. This disease creates damage to  the small intestines and interferes with absorption of nutrients from food when gluten is ingested or touches. Is is considered a digestion disease and an autoimmune disorder. Celiac disease is a genetic disease. It can be triggered or activated for the first time after: -Surgery -Pregnancy. -Childbirth. -Viral infection. -Severe emotional stress.

SYMPTOMS OF CELIAC DISEASE:
Celiac disease may exist without symptoms. There is still a risk for complications, such as malnutrition. It affects people differently. Symptoms may include one or more of the following; -Recurring gas, abdominal bloating, and pain. Chronic diarrhea. Pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stool. -Weight loos or gain. - Fatigue. -Anemia -Bone or joint pain, osteoporosis. -Behavioral changes (irritability is most common in children). Tingling or numbness in legs. -Muscle cramps. -Seizures. -Missed menstrual periods, infertility, and recurrent miscarriage. -Delayed growth (failure to thrive in infants). -Mouth ulcers and tooth discoloration. -Itchy skin rash.

MEASURES TO MANAGE CELIAC DISEASE:
The only treatment for celiac disease is to follow a gluten-free diet. It is a lifetime requirement: -Avoid wheat, rye, or barley products. -Use corn, rice, soy, arrowroot, tapioca, or potato flours in recipes.-Buy plain, frozen, or canned vegetables and season with herbs or spices. -When eating out, select meat, poultry, or fish made without breading, gravies, or sauces. -Store all gluten-free products in the refrigerator or freezer because they do not contain preservative. -Read labels carefully. Buy ""gluten-free"" products. Contact a food manufacturer for product information if in doubt. Family members of a person with celiac disease may want to be tested. Seek others with celiac disease for information and support. 

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Malnutrition and anemia. Lymphoma and adenocarcinoma. Osteoporosis. Miscarriage or congenital malformation. Short stature. Increased risk for other autoimmune disease.
"
TEACHING GUIDE (Alzheimer's Disease),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Dementia es the loss of intellectual and social abilities severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living. Healthy brain tissue degenerates and causes a steady decline in memory and mental abilities.The course of the disease varies, but 8 years is the average length of time from diagnosis to death. Alzheimer's disease takes the mental ability to make decisions as the disease progresses.

RISK FACTORS:
Alzheimer's disease usually affects people older than 65 years. The risk is higher if a first-degree relative has the disease. Women are more likely than men to develop Alzheimer's disease (partially because they longer). Lifestyle choices such as poorly controlled diabetes, obesity, and inactivity can increase the risks. Currently, there is no evidence that any particular substance is toxic or increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease.
 
S/SX :
Increasing and persistent  forgetfulness, eventually forgetting the names of family members and everyday objects. Difficulty with abstract thinking such as writing checks or even recognizing numbers. Difficulty finding the right word, meaning the inability to express thoughts to read and write es eventually lost. Loss of sense of time, dates, and surroundings. Loss of judgment and ability to plan and make decisions. Loss of ability to perform familiar tasks such as cooking, dressing, and so forth. Personality changes such as mood swings, distrust in others, increased stubbornness and frustration, withdrawal from social situations, depression, restlessness, anxiety, aggressive or inappropriate behavior.

MEASURES TO PREVENT:
Measures to aid in general communication
1. Use good eyes contact, and let them know that you are listening.
2. Allow time for person to think and speak
3. Avoid criticizing, correcting, and arguing
4. If you do not understand speech, ask them to point or gesture.
5. Use short, simple words and sentence
Measures to decrease confusion, agitation, or aggression
1. Identify the immediate cause that could have triggered behavior.
2. Limit distraction
3. Create calm environment
4. Avoid noise, glare, distractions, visitors, and so forth.
5. Simplify task and routines.
Measures to manage confusion.
1. Stay calm.
2. Show photos or reminders of important relationship or places.
3. Do not make corrections, but suggest the correct answer.

People with advanced Alzheimer's disease lose the ability to care for themselves and are prone to additional health problems, such as
1. Pneumonia resulting from difficulty swallowing and possible aspiration.
2. Infection mainly caused by urinary incontinence and infections.
3. Falls resulting in fractures or head injuries.
4. Prolonged immobility, which increases the risk of blood clots."
TEACHING GUIDE (Emphysema),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
Emphysema es caused by recurrent inflammations that result in destruction of lung tissue. Destruction and loss of elasticity of alveoli result in decreased air exchange. Emphysema es a chronic disease and damage cannot be reversed.

RISK FACTORS:
Positive family history. Recurrent respiratory infections. Continual exposure to harmful irritants: -Occupational hazards. -Air pollution. Cigarette smoking. Allergies. Most people with COPD are at least 40 year old around middle age. Impaired immune system.

S/SX OF EMPHYSEMA:
The severity of the symptoms depend on how much of the lung has been destroyed. Destruction will continue faster if smoking is continued. Symptoms: -Cough. -Sputum (mucus) production Shortness of breath, especially with exercise. - Wheezing. Chest tightness. Barrel chest (emphysema). - Loss of appetite and weight loss.

MEASURES TO PREVENT EMPHYSEMA:
Stop smoking. Avoid fatigue (energy conservation teaching guide). Eat healthy foods such as lots of fruits and vegetables. Eat protein foods such as meat, fish, eggs, milk, and soy. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Take medications as ordered and make sure you refill them so you do not run out.  Avoid irritants and keep home clean. - avoid newly painted areas or ofter spraying for insects. -Avoid wood or kerosene heaters. -Keep windows closed and stay home when pollen count is high or air pollution is high. Avoid smoking because it destroys ciliary action and increases secretions. Treat all respiratory infections promptly.Receive flue shots and pneumonia immunization. Consult with pulmonary rehabilitation program, which pulmonary rehabilitation program, which provides, exercise training, disease-management training, counseling, help with adjusting activities of daily living to disease, specific instruction with dietician, occupational therapist, respiratory therapist. Oxygen therapy as needed or continuously. Oxygen may help. Do activities with less shortness of breath. Protect heart and other organs from damage. Sleep more during the night. Improve alertness during the day. Avoid excessive heat, which increases oxygen requirements and avoid excessive cold, which increases possibility of bronchospasm. Use humidifier during winter months. Perform measures to maintain patent airways. Drink 105 to 2 quarts if fluids daily to thin secretions. Use a humidifier to moisten air. Wear a Medic Alert bracelet. Get emergency help if you have the following symptoms:
 - Heart is beating very fast and irregularly.
 - Lips or fingernails alert.
 - You are not mentally alert.
 - You are having difficulty talking or walking.

"
TEACHING GUIDES ( Suprapubic Catheter Care),"PHATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is a tubing surgically inserted into the bladder directly through the lower abdomen. It is performed to divert the flow or urine from the urethra.

CARE OF INSERTION SITE OR STOMA:
With new stoma site, cleanse with Betadine solution, and apply sterile drain dressing (slit in one side of dressing) as ordered. Any crusting or exudates around stoma may be cleaned with cotton-tip applicator and hydrogen peroxide and carefully rinsed with water. A healed stoma may be cleansed with mild soap and water daily. A suprapubic  catheter may be taped to the abdomen if necessary. If the catheter accidentally drops out, cover with clean gauze, and secure with tape. Notify physician or nurse promptly.

CATHETER BAGS AND CATHETER TUBING:
Maintain good drainage by checking frequently for kinks or loops in the tubing. Secure catheter tubing to leg to prevent pulling or tension on catheter. Change anchoring sites by alternating sites daily. Use the inner thighs for women and the upper thighs for men. Keep drainage bag below level of the bladder at all times to prevent infection. Empty bag at least every 8 hours or when drainage bag is just over half full. If catheter and tubing are disconnected, wipe the end of both with antiseptic solution before reconnecting them.  Drainage bags may be reused after careful cleansing: -Rise inside of bag with soapy water and them rinse with clear water. Fill the bag with one part vinegar to four parts water and soak for 30 minutes. -Empty the bag, and let it air dry. -Store in clean, dust-free place.

HOW TO EMPTY A DRAINAGE BAG:
Free the drain tip from holder on drainage bag. loosen the clamp and drain urine. Let the urine drain into the toilet or measuring container while being careful not to let the tip touch anything. Reclamp the tube and clean tip before replacing in holder.

HOW AND WHEN TO USE A LEG DRAINAGE BAG:
Leg collection bags are usually used during the day. They usually only hold about 500 ml of urine. The leg bag is attached to the leg with straps. Use cloth or Velcro straps to avoid possible irritation from rubber straps. A drainage valve or cap is secured at the bottom opening of the bag. Use the same precautions when changing or draining the leg bag as when using the large drainage bag.

MEASURES TO PREVENT:
Monitor and record urine output for amount and color of urine. Stress increased intake of clear fluids (10 to 15 glasses per day). Unless prohibited by physician, try drinking cranberry, plum, and prune juices along with water, as they help increase the acidity and prevent infection. Keep intake of caffeine and alcohol to limited amount. Showering and bathing may be done as ordered by physician. Review signs, symptoms, or problems to report promptly, such as: -A lack of urine output longer then 4 hours. -Persistent leakage  around catheter. -Pain swelling, or tenderness around catheter. -A break in the catheter or if the catheter falls out. -Fever or chills. A latex-free catheter may be needed if client has latex allergy.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Urinary-tract infection: cloudy urine, foul odor, fever, and pain in bladder area. Blocked catheter: lack of urine draining into catheter and firm,distended abdomen."
TEACHING GUIDES (Acute Rental Failure),"BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE RENAL SYSTEM:
The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs and are located on each side of the vertebral column at the 12th thoracic vertebrae at the posterior abdominal wall. Each kidney has ureter about 25 to 30 centimeters long that connects to the bladder. The function of the kidneys is to remove waste materials from blood, balance body fluids, and form urine.  

DEFINE ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:
Acute renal failure is the sudden inability of kidneys to remove metabolic wasted and concentrate urine without losing electrolytes. Renal cells  are damaged by decreased renal blood flow and a lack of oxygen and other nutrients to the cells. 

RISK FACTOR:
Low blood pressure caused by trauma, surgery, serious illness, septic shock, hemorrhagic shock, burns, or dehydration. Acute pyelonephritis or septicemia. Urinary tract obstruction. Blood transfusion reaction. Autoimmune kidney disease.   

S/SX:
Nausea and vomiting. Urinary system changes: -A decrease in the amount of urine. -No urination. -Excessive urination at night. Changes in mental status or mood: -Drowsiness or lethargy. -Agitation. -Delirium or confusion. -Coma. -Mood changes. -Trouble paying attention. -Hallucinations. Generalizes swelling and fluid retention. Flank pain between ribs and hips. Headache. Decreased sensation in hands and feet. Decreased appetite and metallic taste in mouth. Slow, sluggish movements, hand tremor, or seizures. Itchiness. Bruising and prolonged bleeding and prolonged bleeding (nosebleeds, blood in stool).

MEASURES TO MANAGE ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:
Follow prescribed diet closely: -High in carbohydrates. -Low in protein. -Low in sodium. -Low in potassium. Monitor fluid status closely: -Weigh daily using the same scale at the same time each day. -Measure intake and output. -Restrict fluids as instructed. Take medications as ordered (possible use of antibiotics and/or diuretic). Avoid infections, or get prompt treatment of infection. Follow activity as ordered with regular rest periods. Provide skin care and oral hygiene: -Keep fingernails short and avoid scratching. -Use lotions to moisturize skin and decrease itchiness. -Use a soft-bristled tooth brush and mouthwash. Keep follow-up appointments with physician and laboratory tests.  Use Medic Alert car and bracelet.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Chronic renal disease. Anemia (loss of blood in the intestines).  End-stage renal disease. Damage to heart or nervous system. Hypertension. Need for dialysis."
TEACHING GUIDES (AIDS),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
Is caused by HIV. HIV kills or damages cells of the body's ability to fight infections and certain cancers. Viruses or bacteria that are not a threat to healthy people become opportunistic and life-threatening infections for the person diagnosed with AIDS. The term AIDS usually applies to the most advanced stages of HIV infection.

METHODS OF TRANSMISSION:
HIV is spread through contact with contaminated blood. Because of blood screening and heat treatment to donated blood, the risk of getting HIV from transfusion is extremely small. HIV is spread most often by having unprotected sex with and infected partner. The virus can enter the body through the lining of the vagina, vulva, penis, rectum, or mouth during sex. HIV can spread among injection drug users by sharing of needles or syringes that are contaminated with infected blood. Women can transmit HIV to their babies during pregnancy or time of birth.

RISKY BEHAVIOR PRACTICES TO BE AVOIDED IN PREVENTION OF THE SPREAD OF THE HIV:
Sharing of drug needles or syringes. Having sexual contact, including oral, with an infected person without using a condom. Having sexual contact with someone whose HIV status is unknown. 

RECOGNIZE EARLY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF HIV:
Flu-like symptoms within a month or two after exposure to the virus. Fever.Headache. Swollen glands. Fatigue.

RECOGNIZE SYMPTOMS EXPERIENCES LATER IN THE COURSE OF THE DISEASE:
""Swollen glands"" for more than 3 months. Weight loss. Frequent fevers and sweats. Persistent or frequent yeast infection of mouth or vagina. Persistent skin rashes. Pelvic inflammatory disease in women that does not respond to treatment. Short-term memory loss. Frequent or severe herpes infections that cause mouth, genial, or anal sores or the painful nerve disease called shingles.

TESTS COMMON FOR DIAGNOSIS OF AIDS:
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (Elisa) Western blot, which is used to confirm the results of the ELISA test.

MEASURES TO PREVENT:
Avoid sex with multiple partners. /avoid intravenous drug abuse. Avoid sharing needles or syringes. Use condoms correctly.
 
MEASURES TO MANGE AIDS AND PREVENT OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS:
Avoid infections with good hand washing and personal hygiene. Avoid exposure to infection, such as people with respiratory infection, shingles, and tuberculosis or children with chicken pox. Report any signs and symptoms of infection. Use stress-management techniques. Set up an emotional support network with family, friends, or support groups. Eat a nutritious diet. Check high-calorie diet in therapeutic diets. Check food safety and prevention of food-borne illness in nutrition education. Maintain a balance of rest and exercise. Avoid donating blood or semen. Inform health care providers of diagnoses. Inform sex partners of diagnosis. keep follow-up appointments with physician and laboratory. Avoid alcohol and tobacco product use. Avoid exposure to infection, such as people with respiratory infections, shingles, and tuberculosis or children with chicken pox.

MEASURES TO MAINTAIN BODY REQUIREMENTS FOR NUTRITION:
Provide good oral hygiene. Eat small, more frequent meals. Rest one-half hour after meals. Take medication (antiemetics) for nausea and vomiting as needed.

PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS:
Personal care: -Hands and other parts of the body should be washed immediately after contact with blood or other body fluids. Surfaces soiled with blood should be disinfected appropriately. -Gloves should be worn during contact with blood or other body fluids that could possibly contain visible blood, such as urine, feces, or vomit. -Cuts, sores, or breaks on both the caregivers and client's exposed skin should be covered with bandages. Equipment: -Needles and other sharp instruments should be used only when medically necessary. -Do not put caps back on needles by hand. Do not remove needles from syringes. Dispose of needles in puncture-proof containers out of the reach of children and visitors. Infected persons should no share razors, toothbrushes, tweezers, nail or cuticle items, pierced earrings, or other pierced jewelry. -Disposable gloves should only be used once and then discarded. Household items and linens; -Clothes and bed sheets used by someone with AIDS can be washed the same way as other laundry. -If clothes or sheets have blood, vomit, semen, vaginal fluids, urine, or feces on them, use disposable gloves and handle the clothes or sheets as little as possible. -Put soiled linens in plastic bags until you can wash them. You can but do not need to add bleach to kill HIV; a normal wash cycle will kill the virus. -Fabrics and furniture can be cleaned with soap and water or cleansers that you can buy in a store; follow the directions on the box. Wear gloves while cleaning. -About one-quarter cup of bleach mixed with 1 gallon of water makes a good disinfectant for floors, showers, tubs, sinks, mops, sponges, and so forth."
TEACHING GUIDES (AIDS) Continued,"PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS:
 -Soiled disposable items such as gloves, soiled underpants, or dressings should be secured in heavy-duty plastic garbage bags. -Clean food preparation area and bathroom area with hot, soapy water and then with a solution that is one part bleach to mine parts water. Personal: -The proper and consistent use of latex or polyurethane (a type of plastic) condoms when engaging in sexual intercourse-vaginal, anal, or oral-can  greatly reduce a person's risk of acquiring or transmitting sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection. -If a person with AIDS has fever blisters or cold sores (herpes simplex) around the mouth or nose, do not kiss or touch the sores. -If you have touch the sores to help the person, wear gloves and wash your hands carefully as soon as you take the gloves off. Proper condom use: -Use latex or polyurethane condoms. Never reuse a condom. -Store condoms in cool, dry place. Do no store in car or wallet. -Check expiration date. Place condom on an erect (hard) penis before any contact with partner's genital area. -Use water-based lubricant with latex condoms to help prevent the condom from tearing. Do not use oil-based products, such as baby or cooking oils, hand lotion or petroleum jelly as lubricants. -Hold condom in place at the base of penis before withdrawing after sex. -Properly dispose of condom. Avoid use of lubricants with spermicide called nonoxynol-9 (N-9). It may cause skin irritation or abrasions that can make the area more susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases."
TEACHING GUIDES (Anemia),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
Is a disorder in which there is an abnormally low amount of hemoglobin or red cells. It can be caused by: -Excessive loss of red bloods cells. - Destruction of red blood cells. -Impaired production of red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin es essential for carrying oxygen to the cells.

MEASURES TO PREVENT ASTHMA
Identify and avoid precipitating factors and warning signs. Take long-term medications that are ordered to control chronic symptoms and prevent attacks. Quick relief medications are ordered for rapid, short-term relief of symptoms. Other medications are ordered to decrease sensitivity to allergens. Be careful to keep extra medication on hand. keep emergency medication available with you in case of asthma attack. Avoid aspirin and aver-the-counter drugs that contain aspirin. Prevent upper-respiratory infections:
1. Avoid exposure to persons with respiratory infection
2. Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated areas
3. Obtain immunization against influenza and pneumonia
4. Report early signs of infection (i.e., increased cough, shortness of breath, fever, and chills).

Eat a well-balanced diet. Drink 2 o 3 quarts of fluid each day to liquefy secretions. Use stress-management techniques. Exercise daily, avoiding overexertion. Avoid exercise in cold temperatures. Obtain allergy shots as recommended.

Environmental measures are: Use air conditioner, close windows during pollen season, use dehumidifier if needed to maintain optimal humidity. Change water daily. Keep air conditioner and furnace serviced and clean. Reduce pet dander by avoiding pets with fur or feathers. Clean home regularly. Wear a mask if doing the cleaning yourself. Control heartburn and GERD to prevent complications. 

Status asthmaticus (prolonged symptoms of asthma), pneumonia, respiratory arrest, emphysema, bronchitis, right-sided heart failure."
TEACHING GUIDES (Bladder Control Problems),"DEFINE TYPES OF BLADDER CONTROL CAUSED BY NERVE DAMAGE:
Nerves carry signal from the brain to the bladder and sphincter. Damage can cause bladder control problems. Overactive bladder: -Urinary frequency-eight or more times a day. -Urinary urgency-eight or more times a day. -Urinary urgency-sudden, strong need to urinate immediately. -Urge incontinence-leakage of urine that follows a sudden urge. Poor control of sphincter muscles-may allow leakage of urine. Urine retention-bladder does not receive message to empty.

CAUSAS OF THIS TYPE OF NERVE DAMAGE:
Vaginal childbirth. Diabetes. Stroke. Infections of the brain or spinal cord. Trauma or injury to the brain or spinal cord. Multiples sclerosis. Heavy metal poisoning.

MEASURES TO MANAGE URINARY CONTROL PROBLEMS:
Do bladder training. Do kegel exercise. Use barrier garments or external collection devices (condom catheter). Assess for skin breakdown or irritation. Control odors by: -Frequent cleansing of the perineum. -Changing to clean clothes. -Room deodorizer. Avoid using perfume or scented powders, lotions, or sprays. Keep a record of fluid intake. Drink plenty of fluids  during morning and early afternoon. Decrease fluid intake during evening. Contact the physician if any of the following occurs: -Rash around the perineal area. Pain in lower abdomen. -Fever or chills. -Cloudy urine.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Rash, skin infections, or sores. Urinary tract infections. Sleep problems. Less social and sexual activity. A loss of self-esteem. Depression."
TEACHING GUIDES (Bowel Obstruction),"UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE INTESTINES:
The small intestine is approximately 18 feet long and extends from the stomach to the large intestine. The large intestine, which is much shorter and wider, ascends up the right side of the abdomen, is horizontal across the abdomen, and descends on the left side of the abdomen.

DEFINE CONTENTS OBSTRUCTION:
A blockage prevents the contents from passing normally through the intestines, and it can occur in either the large or small intestine. There are two basic types of obstructions: -Mechanical obstruction occurs when something physically stops the passage of fecal contents (may be caused by rumors, adhesion's, hernias, etc.). Paralytic obstruction is the cessation of peristalsis caused by trauma, infection, toxins, surgery, and so forth. When obstruction occurs, intestinal contents, fluids, and accumulate.

RISK FACTORS:
Inflammatory disease. Tumor. Hernia. Fecal impaction. Postoperative scar tissue (adhesion's). Foreign bodies (ingested material that obstruct the intestines). Congenital strictures. Strictures or scars from radiation therapy.

RECOGNIZE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:
Paralytic ileus is marked bye: -Abdominal distention. -Absent bowel sounds. -Relatively little pain. Mechanical obstruction: -Abdominal fullness and distention. -Abdominal pain and cramping. -Vomiting. -Failure to pass gas or stool. -Breath odor.

POSSIBLE TREATMENT:
Intravenous fluids to replace fluids . Nasogastric tube to drain fluids and gas. Surgery.
POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
A lack of blood supply to the bowel, which can cause gangrene and death of the bowel tissue. Perforation (hole) in the intestine.

TEACHING GUIDES (Breast Cancer),"DEFINE BREAST CANCER:
Breast cancer is second only to lung cancer as cause of cancer deaths in American women, One in every nine women may get breast cancer. It is staged according to size of primary lesion, extent of spread to regional lymph nodes, and metastasis to other parts of body. Pager's disease is found in 1% to 4% of breast cancer . It involves skin changes in the nipple caused by a tumor growing through the ducts into the nipple.

RISK FACTORS:
Factors that increase risk: -Females (males also get breast cancer). -Aging increases risk (80% of breast cancers occur in women older than 50 years). -Personal history of breast cancer. -Positive family history (mother, sister, or daughter with either breast or ovarian cancer). -Genetic predisposition. -Radiation exposure (the younger the exposure, the grater the risk). -Excess weight (especially weight around the waist). -Exposure to estrogen (late menopause, after age of 55; early menses, before age of 12; women who have never had children's; or first pregnancy after 35).-Higher risk of developing breast cancer in white women (but black women are more likely to die of breast cancer). Hormone therapy (especially combination of estrogen plus progestin). -Talk with physician about the current reports of birth control pill use as a risk factor. -Smoking (even exposure to secondhand smoke) -Exposure to pesticides, chemical components of cigarette smoke, and so forth. -Excessive use of alcohol. -Breast density.

MEASURES FOR EARLY DETECTION:
Mammograms. The American Cancer Society (2003) and national Cancer Institute (2004) guidelines suggest and annual mammogram for women 40 years old and older. Self-breast exams. Know how your breast normally feel, and report any changes to your doctor. Starting in your 20s, breast-examination is an option. A health care professional exam is important every 3 years until the age of 40, and then annual exams should be performed.

WARNING SIGNS OF BREAST CANCER:
A lump or thickening (often painless) in the breast or in the underarm area. A change in the size or shape of the breast. Nipple tenderness. A retraction or indentation of nipple or of the skin over breast. Spontaneous clear or bloody discharge from nipple. Redness or pitting of the skin over the breast, areola, or nipple (like the skin of an orange)."

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Dehydration. Acute respiratory distress. Septic shock (infection). Circulatory collapse. Anemia. Disuse atrophy and contractures. Scarring. Stress diabetes. Depression."
TEACHING GUIDES (Cardiac Arrhythmia's),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
The heart has its own conduction system that produces the rate and rhythm of each heart beat. When this conduction system is not working properly, the result is an abnormally slow or rapid heart rate that does not function in the usual manner. Some arrhythmia's do not need treatment, whereas other can quickly lead to life threatening situations.

NORMAL CARDIAC RHYTHM:
A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Each impulse or beat occurs in an even, regular rate.

POSSIBLE PREDISPOSING FACTORS FOR ARRHYTHMIAS:
Myocardial ischemia related to coronary artery disease. Congestive heart failure. Pain. Anxiety and stress. Endocrine disorders. Electrolyte imbalances. Valvular heart disease. Side effects of medications.

KNOWLEDGEABLE OF METHODS OF TREATMENT FOR DYSRHYTHMIAS:
Drug therapy. Elective electrical cardioversion is used with non-life-threatening dysrhythmias. It is a non-emergency procedure done by a physician usually as an outpatient status. Defibrillation. This treatment is used only in a life-threatening situation. Automatic implanted cardiac defibrillator (AICD) is an internal electrical device used for clients with life-threatening dysrhythmias. This client has had previous episodes of cardiac arrest and survived but is still at risk for sudden cardiac death. Pacemaker. They treat clients with abnormally slow heart rhythms and can be temporarily used or surgically implanted for permanent use. Permanent pacemakers function either on demand or at a fixed-rate pacer. The demand pacer will activate if pulse rate falls below a set rate per minute. The fixed-rate is preset when inserted ta a specific rate (use the pacemaker teaching guide).

EDUCATIONAL TOPICS AND SKILLS NEEDED FPR POST-HOSPITAL CARE:
Knowledge of how to monitor blood pressure and the rate and rhythm of pulse. Awareness of how to secure emergency help. Call 911. Have telephone numbers of physician and brief history including medication available for first responders. Have home emergency alert system for client who lives alone. Be able to evaluate for symptoms of distress other than change in pulse rate: -Shortness of breath. -Lightheadedness. -Sweating. -Chest pain. -Palpitations. -Skin becomes pale and cool. -Disoriented or confused mental state. Ensure understanding and compliance of medication prescribed. Understanding of need for follow-up care by physician and/or any appointments for testing. Wear medical alert identification for disease and any use of pacemaker or AICD. Ensure understanding of any implanted pacemaker or AICD maintenance (use the pacemaker teaching guides).


POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Myocardial infarction. Cardiac arrest leading to sudden death."
TEACHING GUIDES (Cardiomyopathy),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
There is a chronic condition with structural changes in the heart muscle. The heart muscle loses its ability to pump blood efficiently and is a chronic condition often resulting in heart failure. There are three major types of cardiomyopathy: dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive.

S/SX:
Shortness of breath (dyspnea) on exertion and when lying down. Fatigue leading to decreased activity tolerance. Swelling of the legs. Palpitations. Chest pain. Fainting, lightheartedness, or passing out after activity. Low amount of urine during day but need to urine at night possible cough.

FACTORS THAT WILL HELP MANAGE THE DISEASE:

"
TEACHING GUIDES (Cholesterol-Lowering Diets),"PHATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
Is a soft, fat-like substance in the bloodstream of the body. It is produced by the liver, and we ingest large amounts by eating meat and dairy products. Too much cholesterol directly increases the risk of heart disease. A lipid profile is the test often used to evaluate risks for coronary heart disease (the 2001 guidelines from the National Cholesterol Education Panel recommended that all lipid tests be performed after fasting and should measure all four cholesterol components: total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, and triglycerides). A lipid profile includes high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, very low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. High-density liporpoteins help to carry away or remove excess cholesterol from the blood stream. Normal values are 45 to 55 mg/dl or higher. Low-density lipoproteins are most responsible for plaque formation that clogs arteries and creates atherosclerotic plaques. Normal values are between 60 t0 180 mg/dl. This can vary with the client's risk for heart disease. Triglycerides are fasts in the body. they are frequently elevated in clients with obesity, cardiac disease, and diabetes. Triglyceride levels should be less than 150 mg/dl. A goal for total cholesterol should be below 200 mg/dl.

DECREASE SERUM CHOLESTEROL LEVELS:
Limit milk to skim milk, 1% milk, or cultured buttermilk, and use nonfat or low-fat yogurt or cottage cheese. Limit brads made without whole milk, eggs, or butter. Do not prepare vegetables with butter, cream, or cheese sauce. Use lean meats with fat trimmed and poultry without skin. Cut down on saturated fats. Use  only two egg yolks per week. Use egg whites or egg substitute. Use monounsaturated oils and low-fat dressings. Preferred oils are peanut, olive, and canola oils. Use low-fat frozen desserts or frozen fruit ices, angel-food cake, and low-fat cookies and snacks. Use nonfat beverages, carbonated drinks, juices, tea, and coffee. A diet rich in fiber ( 20 to 30 grams per day) may also help to reduce cholesterol levels. Limit cholesterol dietary intake to 3000 mg or less daily.

LOWER CHOLESTEROL AND TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS:
Avoid alcohol. Cook by boiling, baking, or roasting instead of frying. Increase activity level. Achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Avoid trans-fatty acids and hydrogenated oils used in margarine, commercially prepared cookies, cakes, and so forth. Limit sugar intake. Read labels to determine sources of saturated fats and cholesterol. Consult with registered dietitian. Medication therapy as prescribed by physician."
TEACHING GUIDES (Chronic Renal Failure),"BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE RENAL SYSTEM:
The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs and are located on each side of the vertebral column at the 12th thoracic vertebrae at the posterior abdominal wall. Each kidney has ureter about 25 to 30 centimeters long that connects to the bladder. The function of the kidneys is to remove waste materials from blood, balance body fluids, and form urine.  

DEFINE CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:
It is the irreversible deterioration of renal function. Symptoms may occur very rapidly or very slowly over years. Uremia, an excess of urea and other nitrogenous wastes, occurs. Progression may continue to en-stage renal disease.

RISK FACTORS:
Obstruction of the urinary tract. Toxic agents. Uncontrolled high blood pressure. Diabetes mellitus. Kidney diseases. Re-currents infections.

S/SX:
Initial symptoms of chronic renal failure are: -Loss of appetite. -Unintentional loss of weight. -Fatigue, apathy, and weakness. -Nausea or vomiting. -Frequent hiccups. -Generalized itching. Later symptoms may include: -Increased or decreased urine output. -Easy bruising or prolonged bleeding. -Decreased alertness, confusion, and coma. -Muscle twitching or cramps. -Seizures. -Decreased sensation in hands and feet. -Uremic frost (deposit or white crystal in and on the skin). Late symptoms may be: -Excessive nighttime urination. -Excessive thirst. -Abnormally dark skin or paleness. -Nail abnormalities. -Breath odor. -High blood pressure. -Loss of appetite. -Agitation.

MEASURES TO MANAGE CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:

Seizures. Dementia. Fractures and joint disorders. Changes in glucose metabolism. Electrolyte imbalance. Decreased libido, impotence. Menstrual problem and infertility. Dry, itchy skin with probable skin infections."
TEACHING GUIDES (Colostomy Care),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
Is a surgical opening between the large intestine and the surface of the abdomen. A small portion of the intestine es sewed to the surface of the abdomen creating a ""stoma"". The purpose of the colostomy es to bypass the diseased rectum and colon to rid the body of solid wastes. The large intestine consists of the ascending, transverse, and descending portions. Its primary purpose is to absorb water and store feces.

THREE TYPES OF COLOSTOMIES:
Ascending colostomy has a stoma that is located on the right side of the abdomen. The output that drains is in liquid form. Transverse colostomy has a stoma that es located in the upper abdomen the middle or right side. The output that drains is loose or soft. Descending or sigmoid colostomy has a stoma that is located on the lower left side of the abdomen. The output that drains is firm.

TYPES OF COLOSTOMY POUCHES:
An open-ended pouch is open at the bottom to drain output. The open end of this pouch is usually closed with a plastic clamp. This type of pouch is used by people with an ascending or transverse colostomies. Closed-ended pouch is filled. This type of pouch is usually used by people with a descending or sigmoid colostomy. A one-piece pouch has the pouch and the adhesive skin barrier as one piece. When the pouch requires changing, the new pouch must be reattached to the skin. The two-piece pouch has two parts, including the adhesive flange and the pouch. The adhesive part remains when the pouch is cleaned or replaced.

EMPTYING THE POUCH:
Empty when one third full. Sit on toilet or place on chair with the pouch opening placed in the toilet. Put toilet paper on the surface of the toilet water to avoid splashing. Remove clamp and let contents empty into toilet. Squeeze the remaining contests out of the pouch. While holding up the end of the pouch, pour a cup of water into pouch, swish, and empty. Do not get the stoma or adhesive seal wet. Use toilet paper to clean around opening of pouch and clamp pouch shut

PROCEDURE OF CHANGING THE POUCHING SYSTEM:
Change pouch every 5 to 7 days or as needed. Assemble all of the equipment. Hold skin taut, and peel off the pouch being worn. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water, rise, and par dry. Inspect the stoma for any change in size or color. Inspect the skin for signs of irritation and apply  skin barrier. Apply pouch over the stoma.

DIETARY MEASURES FOR MANAGEMENT OF COLOSTOMY:
Eat a healthy balanced diet. Eat slowly and chew well. Avoid the use of straws to reduce gas. Foods that may help to control odor and gas in some people are fresh parsley, yogurt, and buttermilk. Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water or liquids each day. Healthy choices are water, juices,  and milk. Limit the intake of caffeine and soda. Foods that may cause gas and odor are: Broccoli, cabbage, cucumber, Brussels sprouts, or cauliflower. Beans, eggs, and fish. Cheese, onions, garlic, or alcohol.

GENERAL MEASURES FOR MANAGEMENT OF COLOSTOMY:
Avoid contact sports and weight lifting. Avoid tight, constrictive clothing. Bathing, showering, and swimming can be done with appliance on. Keep extra colostomy supplies on hand. Report to physician any change in  size or color of stoma, persistent diarrhea or severe constipation, frank bleeding from stoma, purulent drainage or pain at stoma, and fever. Provide information concerning sexual activity, such  as. Resume sexual activity when stoma es healed. Empty pouch before intercourse. Get counseling if needed."
TEACHING GUIDES (Congestive Heart Failure),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
The heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to meet the body's metabolic needs. Heart failure describes the accumulation of blood and fluids in organs and tissues as a result impaired heart function. Heart failure is classified as acute or chronic and right sided or left sided.

BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE HEART:
The heart consist of four chambers: the right and left ventricles and the right and left atria. The upper chambers, the atria. The  upper chambers, the atria, receive the blood from various parts of the body and pump it into the ventricles. The right ventricle pumps blood into the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps blood into all parts of the body. The primary reason for heart failure or decreased cardiac output is damage to muscular wall of the heart.

RISK  FACTORS:
Myocardial infarction. Coronary artery disease, Hypertension. Congenital heart defects. Obesity. Aging. Diabetes mellitus.

S/SX:
Left-sided  failure produces hypoxemia and respiratory symptoms. -Fatigue with activity. -Effort at breathing when active (exertional dyspnea). -Inability to breathe unless sitting upright (orthopnea). -Awakening at night by breathlessness (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea). -Elevated blood pressure. -Productive cough with pink, frothy sputum. -Decreased urine output. -In acute situation, pulmonary edema develops demonstrated by sudden, hypoxic, restlessness, and confusion. -Elevated blood pressure. Right-sided failure. -Gradual unexplained weight gain from fluid retention. -Dependent pitting edema in feet and ankles. -Fluids retention in sacral area or abdomen (ascites). -Loss of appetite and/or nausea. -Dyspnea as a result of enlarged abdomen.

MEASURES TO PREVENT:
Lifestyle changes include stress reduction and energy conservation. Schedule rest periods  to reduce fatigue and dyspnea. Follow the diet or any fluid restrictions prescribed by physician. Take medication exactly as prescribed. Avoid tobacco and alcohol. Weigh daily at the same time of day using the same scale. Notify if a more than 2-pound gain in 24 hours id identified. Measure pulse rate and blood pressure daily. Report a heart rate that is less than 60 beats per minute or more than 120 beats per minute. Elevate Legs while sitting. Avoid extreme heat, cold, or humidity. Keep follow-up appointments with physician and have laboratory work obtained as ordered.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Acute pulmonary edema. Damage to organs such as liver, kidney, or brain. Pneumonia. Electrolyte imbalance related to diuretic therapy. Need for oxygen therapy"
TEACHING GUIDES (Coronary Artery Disease),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is progressive disease characterized by a narrowing or blockage of one or both of the coronary arteries causing a decreased blood supply to the heart. The decreased blood supply creates a lack of oxygen and nutrients to the heart and can cause tissue damage. The disease develops slowly and may be very advanced before symptoms occur. The primary cause is atherosclerosis, which is the buildup of fatty, fibrous plaque on the inner wall of the artery, causing it to become narrowed and hardened. Another cause is arteriosclerosis, produced by loss of elasticity of arteries.

RISK FACTORS:
Controllable factors, cigarette factors, elevated blood pressure, stress, high-cholesterol diet, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, diabetes mellitus, the use of estrogen oral contraceptives. Non-controllable factors, age (risk increases with age), sex(incidence rate in men is three times that of women), race (incidence rate is higher in blacks than in whites), family history.

MEASURES TO PREVENT:
Limit cholesterol, sodium, and saturated fat intake (diets related to cardiovascular disease. Take medication as prescribed. establish exercise program approved by physician.  

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
A. Myocardial infarction
B. Angina pectoris
C. Heart failure
D. Dysrhythmias
E. Cardiac arrest."
TEACHING GUIDES (Cushing's Syndrome),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is a hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol. The adrenal glands release cortisol into the blood stream. Cushing's syndrome is caused by an overproduction of cortisol. It most commonly affects adults who are 20 to 50 years old.

EXPLAIN WHAT CAUSES THE HIGH LEVELS OF CORTISOL:
Use of glucocorticoid hormones like prednisone for chronic health conditions. The body overproduces the amount of cortisol because: -Benign pituitary tumors, benign adrenal tumors cause a chain reaction that results in increased cortisol levels. - Other benign or malignant rumors that grow outside the pituitary can cause the same reaction. The most common is malignant lung rumors.

SYMPTOMS OF CUSHING'S SYBDROME:
General physical features or change in appearance are as follows: -A tendency again weight, especially around abdomen, face (moon face), and neck and upper back (buffalo hump). -Thinning and weakness of the muscle of the upper arms and legs. Thinning of skin with easy bruising and pink or purple stretch marks on the abdomen, thighs, breasts, and shoulders. -Increased acne. -Growth of facial hair. -Scalp hair loss for women. -Reddening complexion on the face and neck. -Skin darkening (acathosis) on the neck. Other symptoms may be as follows: -Elevated blood pressure. -Fatigue and weakness. -Depression or mood swings. -Increased thirst and urination. Common laboratory finding changes are as follows: - Elevated white blood count. Elevated blood sugar. Low serum potassium.

COMPLICATIONS OF UNTREATED DISEASE:
Increased weakness and fatigue. Poor skin healing. Osteoporosis of the spine. Increased susceptibility to infections such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. Increased risk of peptic ulcers.

TREATMENTS FOR CUSHING'S SYNDROME:
If the cause is long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones to treat another disorder, the physician will reduce it to he lowest adequate dose and monitor the use carefully. Other treatments may include the following: -Surgery. Radiation. -Chemotherapy. -The use of cortisol-inhibiting drugs.

IMPORTANT MEASURES TO MANAGE DISEASE:
Monitor: -Blood glucose(sugar) levels. Blood pressure. Weight (weekly). -Signs of edema. -Stools for change in color or that test positive for blood. -Mood changes or increasing depression. Teach:  -Safety precautions to prevent falls or injury. -The use of medications such as diuretic (fluid pill) or changes in medications. Rest periods between activities. Exercise with rest periods. Avoidance of exposure to infections. No nonprescription drugs without physician's approval. Recommended diet, usually sodium restricted diet. -Good skin care and hygiene. -Expression of feelings over any physical changes. -Ways to modify appearance to improve self-esteem. report: Any epigastric pain or discomfort. Any sores or cuts that do not heal. - Any changes in glucose levels, weight, and blood pressure or evidence of blood in stool. Any mood changes or depression."

Eat a well-balanced diet: -Avoid coffee, alcohol, and soft drinks with caffeine, citrus juices, and spicy foods until infection has cleared. -Physician may recommend the use of vitamin C supplements. -Studies have shown cranberry juice to inhibit growth of E. coli. Check with physician before using cranberry juice. Cranberry juice may have a negative interaction with the medication Coumadin. Take antibiotics until completed. Report early signs and sumptoms of infection to the physician. Take medications as instructed. Shower instead of bathing to devrease possibility of bacteria entrance. Exercise regulaarly to prevent urinary stasis. Keep follow-up appointments with physician and laboratory."
TEACHING GUIDES (Decubitus Ulcer) (Pressure Ulcer),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is an area of skin where a lack of blood flow has caused tissue destruction. It is caused by pressure, friction, or shearing (a combination of pressure and friction) force on the skin. The outer skin, the epidermis, is made up of layered cells. It contains the pigment that makes up our skin color. The next layer is the dermis, which contains the oil and sweat glands, hair follicles, blood vessels, and nerves. Below the dermis is the subcutaneous layer, which contains fat cells and connective tissue to act as a shock absorber and insulator for the body.

RISK FACTORS:
Impaired circulation and sensation . Immobility. Incontinence of feces or urine. Malnutrition. Skin pressure, friction, and shearing. Edema. Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, dementia, and peripheral vascular disease, overweight or underweight.

TEACHING GUIDES (Diabetes Mellitus),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is disease in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin. Insulin es a hormone produced in the pancreas and is necessary for the body to turn sugar and other foods into energy. A lack of insulin leads sugars to build up to unsafe levels in the blood. Diabetes mellitus is defines as a fasting blood sugar level of 126mg/dl or more. ""Pre-Diabetes"" is when blood glucose (sugars) are higher than normal, but not yet diabetic. -Prediabetics have an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. -They have impaired fasting glucose levels (100 to 125 mg/dl). They have impaired glucose tolerance (fasting glucose less than 126 mg/dl and a glucose level between 140 and 199 mg/dl 2 hours after taking an oral glucose tolerance test).

THREE MAJOR TYPES OF DIABETES:
Type of diabetes: -Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in childhood. Daily injections of insulin are required to sustain life. Type 2 diabetes usually occurs in adulthood. The pancreas does not make enough insulin to keep blood glucose (sugar) levels normal. Many people do not know they have this type. This type is becoming more common because of age, obesity, and a lack of exercise. -Gestational diabetes is high blood glucose levels that develop at any time during pregnancy in a person who does not have diabetes.

RISK FACTORS:
-A parent, brother, or sister with diabetes. -Obesity. -Age grater than 45 years. -Members of some ethnic groups (particularly African American and Hispanics). -Gestational diabetes or delivering a baby weighing more than 9 pounds. -High blood pressure. -High triglyceride or  cholesterol levels. American Diabetes Association recommends that all adults be screened for diabetes at least every 3 years. A person at high risk should be screened more often.

S/SX:
Symptoms of type 1 diabetes: -Increased thirst. -Increased thirst. -Weight loss in spite of increased appetite. -Fatigue. -Nausea. -Vomiting. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes: -Increased thirst. -Increased urination. -Increased appetite. -Fatigue. -Blurred vision. -Slow-healing infection. -Impotence in men.

WAYS THE DIABETIC CAN TEST GLUCOSE LEVELS:
Urine analysis to check for glucose and ketones. Fasting blood glucose level. Random (non-fasting) blood glucose level. Oral glucose tolerance test. Hemoglobin A1c to measure the average blood glucose during the previous 2 yo 3 months. A non-diabetic person has a value of 5%. The diabetic client should try to keep it below 7%.

LIST NECESSARY SKILLS TO DEAL WITH DIABETES:
Know when and what to eat. Know how to test and record blood glucose. Know how to recognize and treat low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Know how to take insulin and/or oral medication. Know how to adjust insulin and/or food intake when changing exercise and eating habits.

MEASURES IMPORTANT IN MANGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS:
Achieve and maintain ideal weight. Some people with type 2 diabetes find that they no longer need oral medication if they lose weight and increase daily activity. The diet should be: -Consistent in carbohydrates during three meals and three snacks daily (check consistent carbohydrate therapeutic diets-chapter 25). -A Registered dietician can help in learning glycemic index of foods. -My Pyramid is a great source for information. EXERCISE: -Do daily. -Perform at the level appropriate for current fitness level. -Monitor blood glucose levels before and after exercise. -Drink extra fluids (without sugar) before, during, and after exercise. -Carry food that contains a fast-acting carbohydrate in case you experience hypoglycemic reaction.-Oral medication (see Medications classification - Chapter 27). -Oral medications that perform ans increase in insulin production by the pancreas, increase sensitivity to insulin, or delay absorption of glucose. -Different types of oral medications may be combined. FOOD CARE: -Check feet daily. Report any sores or changes with signs of infection. -Wash feet daily with lotion or prescribed creams. -Exercise daily to promote good circulation. -Wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes. -See a podiatrist for foot problems, such as corns or calluses. -Remind health care provider to examine feet without shoes and socks during your routine visits. -Stop smoking. -Avoid going without shoes. -Clip nails straight across, and gently file with an emery board. EYES CARE: -Have a complete dilated eye examination every year. Have a comprehensive eye exam that includes visual acuity testing that measures how well you see at various distances and dilated eye exam that can reveal any damage to retina or optic nerve. Tonometry used ans instrument to measure pressure inside the eye. SKIN CARE: -Bathe every day with mild soap and lukewarm water. Use lotion as needed. -Avoid scratches or bruises. Wash cuts and scrapes with soap and water, and cover with bandage. -Wear gloves when you work. -Use sunscreen. -Dress appropriate to weather. 
SKIN CARE:
-Use sunscreen. -Dress appropriate to weather. -Call physician if skin injury does not heal.

DENTAL CARE:
Signs and symptoms: Polyuria (frequent or excessive urination). -Polydipsia (extreme thirst). -Polyphagia (excessive hunger). Possible causes of hyperglycemia: -One of the first signs of diabetes. -Excess food. -Insufficient insulin production. -Lack of exercise. -Infection. Obesity.

Signs ans symptoms include the following: -Sweating. -Tremors. -Anxiety. -Hunger. Dizziness. -Headache. -Cloudy vision. -Confusion. -Abnormal behavior. -Convulsions. -Loss of consciousness. Possible causes of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) include the following: -An excessive amount of insulin _inadequate amount of food. -Excessive exercise.

WILL KNOW  WHAT TO DO IF SYMPTOMS OF HIGH OR LOW BLOOD SUGAR OCCURS:
High blood sugar: -Go to the emergency room. Low blood sugar: Eat some form of simple carbohydrate as soon as possible. Sources of concentrated simple carbohydrates are sweetened fruit juice, candy, cake frosting, or glucose tablets. The following on the list each contain about 15 grams of carbohydrate: -Three glucose tablets. -One-half cup of fruit juice or regular soda. -Six or seven hard candies (not sugar free) -One tablespoon of honey or sugar. Go to the emergency room if symptoms persist.

STATE MANAGEMENT OD DIABETES DURING ILNESSES:
Take your insulin or oral medications. Test your blood sugar before each meal and at bedtime. Follow your meal plan, if you can eat. If you are not eating, take in at least 4 ounces of sugar-containing beverage every hour. Encourage fluids to maintain hydration. Contact your physician if: -You are unable to keep down food, liquids or medication. -Your illness lasts more than 24 hours. -You have blood sugars higher than 240 mg/ml for more than 1 day.

Hyperlipidemia. Hypertension-strokes. Coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerosis. Amputation of extremities."
TEACHING GUIDES (Diabetic Diet),"NUTRITION THERAPY FOR TREATMENT OF DIABETES:
The goal for nutrition therapy with diabetes is to control the blood glucose levels. This can be done by: -Establishing a routine for eating meals and snacks at regular times every day. -Choosing healthy foods in the correct amounts at each meal. -Eating the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal or snack, thus keeping blood sugar from going too high or too low during the day. -Having weight reduction if overweight. -Complying with any ordered drug therapy. There are several methods to help develop an individual eating plan. The following suggestion are: -The glycemic index es one method of counting carbohydrates or maintaining a consistent carbohydrate diet. Foods with a high glycemic index number will increase blood sugar levels more than a food with a lower number. -Food exchange system is when groups of foods are put into categories. One serving in any group is called an exchange from one group can be traded for a serving in another group. -Consistent amounts of each macro nutrient (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) each day. Carbohydrates should consist of 45% to 65% of daily calories. Proteins should consist of 15% to 20% of daily calories. Fats should consist of 20% to 35% of daily calories.

LIST GENERALHEALTHY DIABETIC EATING HABITS:
Limit amount of sweets. Eat often but in smaller amounts. Watch when and how many carbohydrates are eaten. Include lots of whole-grain foods and fruits and vegetables. eat less fat. limit the use of alcohol."
TEACHING GUIDES (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation),"DEFINE DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION AND LIS RISK FACTORS:
It is a disorder of the clotting factors. Small blood clots can form throughout the body and deplete the clotting mechanism. This leaves the body unprotected at sites of real tissue injury and unable to clot. Risk factor include the following: -Blood infections. -Severe tissue injury (burns, etc.). -Cancer. -Reactions to blood transfusions. -Obstetrical complications. -Severe liver disease.

SYMPTOMS AND POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Symptoms are as follow: -Bleeding, possibly from multiple site in the body. -Clot formation evidenced by bluish coloration of the fingers. -Sudden and unexplained bruising. Possible complications are as follows: -Sever bleeding. -Stoke. -A lack of blood flow to arms, legs, or major organs can cause tissue damage. Seek emergency assistance if symptoms or complications occur."

TEACHING GUIDES (Energy Conservation),"It decreases the physical stress on the body and promotes healing. It decreases consumption of oxygen in the body. It is needed for those with respiratory diseases and with physical limitations.

Perform stretching and relaxation exercises before getting out of bed. Use a tub seat and handheld showerhead when bathing when bathing. Rest  before difficult tasks. Take frequent rest periods during the activity. Pace activities, and do not rush. Plan trips before going up and down stairs. Roll, push, or pull instead of lifting. Use a cart to carry things. Organize work area, and keep frequently used items reach. Avoid having a work area that is too high or too low. Delegate work heat and cold. Schedule activity when most able to tolerate it (i.e., after res periods, after pain medication, and at least 1 hour after meals). Sit to perform an activity instead of standing, when possible. Hold objects close to you instead of away from your body. Use arm supports to perform an activity (i.e., resting elbows on table while shaving, brushing teeth, and eating). Limit activity on days of high air pollution."
TEACHING GUIDES (Foley Catheter Care),"PHATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is a catheter inserted through the urethra into the bladder to drain the urine. It is usually  inserted because of: -Incontinence (inability to hold urine). -A neurogenic bladder. -Obstruction causing and inability to release urine. An indwelling Foley catheter is held in place (in the bladder) by a small balloon filled with water.

CATHETER CARE PROCEDURE:
Wash hands well before and after touching the catheter. Use mild soap and water to wash the area around the catheter and perineal area. Wash the catheter by cleaning gently from the meatus outward. For males, retract foreskin 0.5 to 1 inch to cleanse, being sure to replace it when finished. Do not use powders or lotions after cleaning. Procedure should be done at least daily and after each bowel movement. Indwelling catheters should be changed only as necessary. Changing the catheter more frequently only increases chance of infection developing.

CATHETER BAGS AND CATHETER TUBING:
Maintain good drainage by checking frequently for kinks or loops in the tubing. Secure catheter tubing to leg to prevent pulling or tension on catheter. Change anchoring sites by alternating sites daily. Use the inner thighs for women and the upper thighs for men. Keep drainage bag below level of the bladder at all times to prevent infection. Empty bag at least every 8 hours or when drainage bag is just over half full. If catheter and tubing are disconnected, wipe the end of both with antiseptic solution before reconnecting them.  Drainage bags may be reused after careful cleansing: -Rise inside of bag with soapy water and them rinse with clear water. Fill the bag with one part vinegar to four parts water and soak for 30 minutes. -Empty the bag, and let it air dry. -Store in clean, dust-free place.

HOW TO EMPTY A DRAINAGE BAG:
Free the drain tip from holder on drainage bag. loosen the clamp and drain urine. Let the urine drain into the toilet or measuring container while being careful not to let the tip touch anything. Reclamp the tube and clean tip before replacing in holder..

HOW AND WHEN TO USE A LEG DRAINAGE BAG:
Leg collection bags are usually used during the day. They usually only hold about 500 ml of urine. The leg bag is attached to the leg with straps. Use cloth or Velcro straps to avoid possible irritation from rubber straps. A drainage valve or cap is secured at the bottom opening of the bag. Use the same precautions when changing or draining the leg bag as when using the large drainage bag.

MEASURES TO PREVENT:
Monitor and record urine output for amount and color of urine. Stress increased intake of clear fluids (10 to 15 glasses per day). Unless prohibited by physician, try drinking cranberry, plum, and prune juices along with water, as they help increase the acidity and prevent infection. Keep intake of caffeine and alcohol to limited amount. Showering and bathing may be done as ordered by physician. Review signs, symptoms, or problems to report promptly, such as: -A lack of urine output longer then 4 hours. -Persistent leakage  around catheter. -Pain swelling, or tenderness around catheter. -A break in the catheter or if the catheter falls out. -Fever or chills. A latex-free catheter may be needed if client has latex allergy.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Urinary-tract infection: cloudy urine, foul odor, fever, and pain in bladder area. Blocked catheter: lack of urine draining into catheter and firm,distended abdomen."
TEACHING GUIDES (Folic Acid Deficiency),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is a decrease in red blood cells caused by folate deficiency. It can result from: -Poor dietary intake of folic acid. -Malabsorption diseases such as celiac disease. -Some medications. - Increased need for folic acid during pregnancy.

Open (skin pierced over the fracture). Closed (skin intact over the fracture). Complete (break across entire bone). Incomplete (fracture extends only part way through the bone), also called green-stick fracture. Impacted (one bone fragment forcibly driven into another bone fragment). Comminuted (bone broken in several places). Displaced (bone fragments are separated at the fracture line). Complicated (a body organ or other body tissues injured at he time of the fracture).

S/SX:
Deformity. Pain and tenderness. Restricted or limited mobility. Swelling. Bruising. Muscle spasm. Pallor. Numbness and tingling. Shortening of a limb.

ADMINISTER FIRS AID TO A FRACTURE VICTIM:
Move the victim no more than absolutely necessary to prevent further tissue  damage. Assess client's total condition. Remove constricting clothing or jewelry. Cover open wounds with sterile dressing before splinting. Splint injured site before moving to immobilize the joint above and below the fracture. Apply well-padded splints and bandage splints over clothing.

POSSIBLE MEDICAL/SERGICAL TRATMENT OF FRACTURES:
Close reduction (manual realignment of bones). Immobilization of bone. Electrical bone stimulation. Cast, splint, traction, sling, or external fixator. Total joint replacement.

MEASURES TO PROMOTE HEALING AND PREVENT COMPLICATIONS OF A FRACTURE:
Report to physician any signs of coolness, pallor, redness, blueness, numbness, or signs of infection. Eat a well-balanced diet that is high in carbohydrates and proteins. Eat foods that are high in calcium. Take vitamin (A, B, C, and D) and mineral (calcium and zinc) supplements as recommended. Increase fluids to 8 to 10 glasses per day unless contraindicated.

TEACHING GUIDES (Gallbladder and Gallbladder Diseases),"DEFINE FUNCTION OF GALLBLADDER AND BILIARY SYSTEM:
It is a muscular sac located under the liver. It stores and concentrates the bile produced in the liver. It has excess bile that is not immediately needed for digestion. The bile is released into the small intestine in response to food The cystic duct drains the gallbladder. The common bile duct drains into the duodenum. These two ducts for the biliary system.

DEFINE DISEASES OF THE GALLBLADDER:
Gallstones are formed in the gallbladder. They are made up of water, salts, lecithin, cholesterol, and other substances. They can be of various sizes, ranging from sand size particles to larger than 8mm. Biliary colic is when a stone is blocking the opening from the gallbladder. If the stone blocks the cystic duct for a period of time, acute cholecystitis will occur. If the blockage persist, bacteria can grow, resulting in cholangitis. Stones that block the lower end of common bile duct may obstruct secretion from the pancreas and produce pancreatitis.

S/SX:
Abdominal pain that: -Is in the right upper abdomen or the middle of the upper abdomen. -May be recurrent. -May be sharp, cramping, or dull. -May radiate to the back or below the right should blade. -May be made worse by eating fatty or greasy foods. -Can occur within minutes of a meal. Jaundice. Fever. Clay-colored stools. Nausea and vomiting. Heartburn. Excess gas. Abdominal fullness.

LIST TEACHING NEEDS FOR CLIENTS WITH GALLBLADDER DISEASE:
Nutrition instruction should include the following: -Understand and follow diet as prescribed. -High-fiber and low-fat diets are often recommended (check therapeutic diet chapter). -Eat small, more frequent meals to prevent attacks. -Replacement of water-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, D, E, and K) can sometimes be ordered by physician. When to contact physician: -Severe pain. -Jaundice. -Fever. Changes in color of stool or urine. Take medication as prescribed. Types or medication might include the following: -Pain medication. -Medication to relax smooth muscles ans spasm of gallbladder. -Medication to reduce nausea and vomiting. A follow-up appointment with physician and/or surgeon es given at time of discharge."
TEACHING GUIDES (Gastroesophageal Reflux),"DEFINE GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX (GERD):
The esophagus carries food from the mouth to the stomach. A ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus acts like a valve between the esophagus ans stomach. When that ring or sphincter does not close properly, stomach contents may leak back into the esophagus. Stomach contents contain acid, and when they touch the lining of the esophagus, they crate a burning sensation called heartburn.

SYMPTOMS OF GERD AND EXPLAIN WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION:
Symptoms for adults with GERD are: -Heartburn, which is the most common symptom (GERD can be present without this symptoms). -Excessive clearing of the throat. -Problems swallowing. -Feeling that food is stuck in your throat. -Burning in the mouth. Chest pain. Symptoms for children with GERD may be: -Repeated vomiting. -Coughing. 
-Respiratory problems. -Most babies will outgrow GERD by the age of 1 year. Reasons to consult with physician are: -Heartburn or others symptoms more than twice a week. -The use of antacids for more than 2 week.

METHODOS OF TREATMENT AND MEASURES TO MANAGE THIS CONDITION:
Medication ordered by physician: -Take medicine as ordered. -Consult the physician if medication is not effective. Lifestyle changes recommended by physician: -Do not consume alcohol. -Do not smoke -Lose weight if necessary. -Eat smaller, more frequent meals. -Wear loose-fitting clothing. -Avoid lying down for 3 hours after eating. -Raise the head of bed 6 to 8 inches by placing blocks of wood under the bedposts. -Use foam wedge to elevate head, but avoid pillows. Pillows create more pressure on stomach. Nutritional recommendations are to avoid the following: --Chocolate. -Drinks with caffeine or carbonation. -Fatty and fried food. -Garlic and onions. -Mint flavorings. Spicy foods. -Tomato-based foods such as chili and pizza.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Prolonged irritation can result in bleeding, ulceration, or scar formation of the esophagus. Development of Barrett's esophagus that over time can lead to cancer. GERD can aggravate condition such as asthma, chronic cough, and pulmonary fibrosis. There may be a need for surgical repair."
TEACHING GUIDES (Gastrostomy),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is a catheter inserted surgically through the abdomen into the stomach for the purpose of feeding the client. It is used when a client is unable to swallow for a long period of time and in order to provide complete nutrition. They are larger in diameter than most nasogastric tubes. This could result in less chance of the tube becoming blocked. The feeding can be given continuously or intermittently.

FEEDING PROCEDURE:
Gather all equipment. Wash hands well. Put client in an upright position. Aspirate stomach contents to check residual and then return aspirated contents to stomach. (Hold feeding if residual is grater than 50 to 100 ml and notify physician.) Check feeding solution for expiration date. Warm feeding solution to room temperature. Remove clamp and attach bulb syringe to end of gastrostomy tube. If giving bolus feeding. -Pour room temperature feeding solution into syringe and adjust height of syringe to increase or decrease rate of flow. allowing approximately 20 to 30 minutes to infuse. If using pump or continuous feeding. -Pour room-temperature feeding solution into bag and prime tubing by filling with formula to prevent air from going into stomach. -Connect to pump and attach to gastrostomy tube. -Set the pump for quantity to be infused and at what rate. Flush tube after feeding with approximately 30 ml of water or as ordered. Clamp tube securely. Client should remain in an upright position at least 15 to 30 minutes after a meal.

MEASURES FOR SKIN CARE AROUND TUBE:
Keep skin around tubing clean and dry. Apply dressing or ointments as ordered. Report any sings of wound infection (i.e.,fever redness, drainage, odor, and tenderness).

MEASURES TO PREVENT COMPLICATION:
Wash hands well and keep work area very clean to prevent infection. Weigh regularly to detect any weight loss. Keep head of bed elevated at least 30 degrees to prevent aspiration. Refrigerate opened cans of feeding solution and discard after 24 hours to prevent spoilage. Hang only the amount of feeding that will infuse in 4 hours to prevent spoilage and accidental excess infusion. Use a delivery pump for a continuous feeding to assure a correct rate of flow. Infuse slowly at rate ordered by physician to decrease nausea. Flush tube as ordered to prevent clogging. Have client sit in an upright position after eating to prevent aspiration. Assess and monitor blood sugar if diabetic, and report to physician. Wear Medic Alert bracelet to inform others of medical information. Report to physician any intolerance to feedings (i.e., nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea, and abdominal distention). Keep follow-up appointments with physician and laboratory.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Tube obstruction, Aspiration pneumonia, Diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Local skin infection. Inadvertent removal of the tube."
TEACHING GUIDES (Hepatitis),"DEFINE HEPATITIS AND THE TYPES OF HEPATITIS:
Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can result in malfunction and liver damage. It can be acute or chronic. The most common cause of hepatitis is a viral infection. forms of viral hepatitis are: -Hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis or HAV). -Hepatitis B (serum hepatitis or HBV). -Hepatitis C (HCV). -Hepatitis D (HDV). -Hepatitis E HEV). Forms of non viral hepatitis are: -Toxic hepatitis- develops after exposure to chemicals toxic to the liver. -Drugs induced hepatitis-develops as a result of drug reaction.

MODO OF TRANSMISSION FOR EACH FORM OF HEPATITIS:
HEPATITIS A: (incubation period of 3 to 5 weeks) is transmitted by: -Oral route from feces (stool) and saliva of infected person. -Contaminated water, food , and equipment. HEPATITIS B: (incubation period of 2 to 5 months) is transmitted by: -Infected blood products, needles, and dental and surgical equipment. -Sexually through vagina secretions and semen of carriers or with active infection. HEPATITIS C: (incubation period of 2 to 20 weeks) is transmitted by: -Infected blood or blood products. -Sexual contact. HEPATITIS D: (incubation period 2 to 5 months) is transmitted by: -The same way as hepatitis B and occurs as dual infection but not alone. HEPATITIS E: (incubation period is 2-9 weeks) is transmitted by: -Fecal (stool) to oral method. There is low risk of person-to person contact but can be severe in pregnant women.

S/SX:
Sings and symptoms are divided into three phases of hepatitis: preicteric, icteric, and posticteric. The preicteric phase has the following symptoms: -Nausea and vomiting. -A loss of appetite  and weight loss. -Fever. -Complaints of tiredness. -Headaches and joint pain. -Discomfort in the right upper quadrant of abdomen. -Enlargement of the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. -Rash and urticaria (itching of skin). The icteric phase has the additional symptoms: -Jaundice (yellowing tint to skin and eyes). -Pruritus. -Clay-or light-colored stools. -Dark urine. The posticteric phase has the following symptoms: -Ending of previous symptoms. -Liver enlargement. -Continued fatigue.

MEASURES TO PREVENT HEPATITIS INFECTIONS:
Receive vaccinations against hepatitis A,B, and E. Perform thorough hand washing techniques, especially after using toilets. Perform good personal and environmental hygiene. Obtain adequate rest and eat well-balanced diet. Use safe sex practice. Report any known exposure. You may receive immune globulin. Use standard precautions: -Wear gloves if hands come in contact with body fluids. -Wear gown and face shield of body fluids may be splashed. Do not share razors, toothbrushes, or needles. Use household bleach solution (10 parts water to one part bleach) to clean any surface contaminated with blood or feces (stool). Avoid drinking or using any potentially contaminated water. Screen food handlers. Screen public salad bars for presence of sneeze guards and hygienic devices and practices to prevent contamination. Require child care provides to wear gloves during diaper changes and to use routine hand washing. Do not share cigarettes, eating utensils, or beverage containers. Use liquid soap dispensers and electric hand dryer in public restrooms. Avoid placing gingers or hand held objects in mouth.Avoid alcohol and drugs that may cause further damage to liver. Avoid eating raw seafood.

MEASURES TO MANAGE HEPATITIS:
Assess and report any signs of bleeding, confusion, edema, lethargy, and weight changes. Decrease itching: -Take medications or apply lotions as prescribed. -Take cool showers and avoid high temperatures. Keep fingernails short to prevent skin irritation if scratching. -Wear cotton, loose-fitting clothing. Provide general comfort measures: -Quiet environment. -Good mouth care. Good hygiene. Provide adequate nutrition: _Offer small, frequent meals. Because of lack or appetite, try to offer foods that appeal to client and use some Fat (in moderation) to make food appealing to the taste. -Offer high-calorie, high-protein nutritious foods. Check with physician regarding protein content. High levels of ammonia can indicate a need to restrict protein intake. Increase fluids to two liters per day unless contraindicated. Weigh daily, weekly, or ordered. Avoid alcohol. Rest as ordered. Avoid heavy lifting. Use an electric razor and soft-bristled toothbrush to prevent bleeding. Avoid alcohol and drugs that may cause further damage to liver. Avoid over-the counter medications unless recommended by physician, especially aspirin and aspirin products. Keep follow-up appointments with physician and laboratory.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Need for liver transplant. Liver cirrhosis. Hepatitis coma and death."
TEACHING GUIDES (Herpes Zoster) (Shingles),"DEFINE HERPES ZOSTER (SHINGLES):
It is caused by they varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that caused the chicken pox. After you have had chicken pox, the virus lies dormant (not active) in your nerves. Years later, the virus may reactivate in the form of shingles. Pain from this disease can be severe. Risk factors are aging, stress, and impaired immune system.

SYMPTOMS OF HERPES ZOSTER:
It spreads along the nerve tract and causes pain and/or a burning sensation. Symptoms appear on one side of the body or face. A red rash appears with fluid-filled blisters that begin a few days after the pain. Fever appears. Headaches occur. Upset stomach occurs.

MEASURES TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF SHINGLES AND HOW TO MANAGE THE SYMPTOMS:
Measures to prevent spread: -Until  blisters dry and have scabs, avoid contact with anyone who has never had chicken pox, has a weak immune system, newborns, and pregnant women. -Varivax was approved in 1995 as immunization for prevention of shingles. Children got immunized between the ages 12 ans 18 months. Older children and adults who have never had chicken pox can receive this vaccine. The Zostavax vaccine was approved in 2006 for use to prevent shingles. It is recommended for adults over 60 years of age who have had chicken pox but not shingles. Measures to manage disease; -Physician may order pain medication, antidepressant, or anticonvulsant medication for relief of pain. -Keep the affected area clean. -Apply cool, wet compresses to affected areas. -Soak in a tub of lukewarm water or use calamine lotion to relieve itching and discomfort. -Get plenty of rest. -Maintain a healthy diet. -Consult the physician regarding the use of over-the-counter pain relievers.

Postherpetic neuralgia, which occurs when the skin remains painful and sensitive to the touch for months or even years. Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) Hearing problems. Temporary or permanent blindness. Loss of facial movements. Secondary skin infections."
TEACHING GUIDES (Hiatal Hernia),"UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANATOMY OF THE ESOPHAGUS, STOMACH, AND DIAPHRAGM:
The diaphragm is a large sheet of muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity. The esophagus (the food tube) extends down through a small opening in the diaphragm to connect to the stomach. The stomach lies just below the diaphragm.

DEFINE A HIATAL HERNIA:
Hernias occur when one part of the body protrudes through a gap or opening into another part. Hiatal hernia occurs when the muscle tissue surrounding this opening becomes weak and the upper part of the stomach bulges through the diaphragm into the chest cavity.

RISK FACTORS:
Congenital weakness. Advanced age. Smoking. Prolonged illness. Obesity. Pregnancy. Tumors. Restrictive clothing. Heavy lifting.

S/SX:
Heartburn (burning sensation in the esophagus). Belching. Regurgitation of sour tasting liquid in the mouth. Difficulty swallowing because of muscle spasms. Chest pain. Symptoms become worse when leaning forward, straining, lifting heavy objects, lying down, and during pregnancy.

MEASURES TO MANAGE OR PREVENT SYMPTOMS:
Nutritional measures: -Avoid caffeine, coffee, soda, chocolate, and so forth. -Avoid onions, spicy foods, spearmint, and peppermint. -Limit citrus fruits and tomato-based foods. -Limit fatty foods. -Eat small, frequent meals. -Increase fluids. -Increase fiber to prevent constipation. Drink water after meals to cleanse the esophagus. Wait at least 3 hours after eating before going to bed or lying down. Avoid eating before going to bed at night. Do not exercise immediately after eating. Avoid smoking. Lose weight if you are overweight. Elevate the head of your bed. Raise the head of the bed 6 to 9 inches. Use blocks to raise the bed or a foam wedge to raise the mattress. Do not use pillow because they will increase pressure on your abdomen. Avoid wearing tight clothing. Discuss medications with physician for possible causes of heartburn. Do not use over the counter medications without physician approval. Reduce stress by relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, tai chi, or yoga. Avoid heavy lifting. Take medications as ordered. Keep follow-up appointments with physician.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Gastroesophageal reflux disease. Ulceration of the herniated portion of the stomach. Gastritis. Lung aspiration. Slow bleeding and iron-deficiency anemia."
TEACHING GUIDES (Hypertension),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is the occasional or continued elevation of diastolic or systolic pressure. The systolic reading (the top number) represents the pressure exerted on the blood vessel wall when the heart is contracting. The diastolic reading (the bottom number) represents the pressure on the blood vessel while the heart is at rest.

Normal blood  pressure readings should be 120/80 or below. If your systolic reading is 120 to 139 or diastolic is 80 to 89 (or both), then this is considered ""prehypertension."" High blood pressure is a pressure of 140 systolic or higher and/or 90 diastolic or higher that stays elevated over time.

S/SX OF HYPERTENSION:
Dizziness. Headaches, often described as throbbing or pounding. Palpitations. Blurring of vision. Fatigue. Nosebleeds. Insomnia. Nervousness. Chest pain (angina). Shortness of breath (dyspnea).

RISK FACTORS:
Age (persons older than 35 years). Black, close blood relative with hypertension, overweight, stress, high sodium intake, high cholesterol intake, oral contraceptives. cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol use, history of diabetes, gout. or kidney disease, sedentary lifestyle.

MEASURES TO PREVENT HYPERTENSION:
Monitor blood pressure at home, and know what it should be. Take medication exactly as prescribed. Lifestyle changes to reduce stress. Eat balanced meals low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. Stop smoking (use tobacco-cessation teaching guide). Avoid oral contraceptives. Avoid alcohol. Have regular medical checkups. Avoid over-the-counter medications unless recommended by physician. Exercise regularly. Use Medic Alert cards/bracelet.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
A. Myocardial infarction
B. Heart failure
C. Stroke
D. Kidney failure
E. Malignant hypertension"
TEACHING GUIDES (Hyperthyroidism),"BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE THYROID GLAND:
The thyroid gland is located in the lower neck and in front of the trachea. Is is divided into two lobes and is joined by a band of tissue called the isthmus, making it resemble a butterfly. It concentrates iodine from food and uses it to synthesize two hormones. These two hormones regulate the body's metabolic rate.

DEFINE HYPERTHYROIDISM AND POSSIBLE CAUSES:
It is a syndrome that occurs when the thyroid gland produces an excess of thyroid hormones. Excess thyroid hormones cause an increased rate at which the body uses energy. Noncancerous lumps growing in the thyroid gland can also increase the production of hormones and cause hyperthyroidism. Grave's disease (an autoimmune disorder) can attack the thyroid gland and cause overproduction of hormones.

S/SX:
Heat intolerance, sweating. Sudden weight loss. Alterations in appetite. Frequent bowel movements. Changes in vision. Fatigue and muscle weakness. Menstrual disturbance. Impaired fertility. Mental disturbances possibly depression. Sleep disturbances. Tremors. Thyroid enlargement. Rapid heartbeat. Wider, swollen or red eyes. In severe cases exophthalmos, in which eyes appear to protrude because of enlarged muscle and fatty tissue surrounding the eyes.  

MEASURES TO ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMS OF HYPERTHYROIDISM:
RESTLESSNESS: -Avoid emotional or physical stimulation until metabolism returns to normal. -Avoid excessive exercise and plan for rest periods. -Avoid caffeine, yellow and red food dyes, and artificial preservatives. -Avoid aspirin and aspirin products.WEIGHT LOSS: -Eat a high-carbohydrate, high-protein diet. -Monitor weight on a regular basis. DIARRHEA: -Avoid highly seasoned foods. -Use BRAT (bananas, rice, apples, tea) during acute episode. -Increase fluids to maintain hydration. EYEBALL protrusion and eye irritation: -Apply cool moist compresses. -Shield eyes with eyes patches or sunglasses. -Cover or tape eyelids shut at night. -Sleep with head of bed elevated. -Limit fluids and sodium to decrease fluid retention in eyes. -Notify physician of visual disturbances. Use artificial tears or eye lubricants as ordered. HEAT INTOLETANCE;-Provide cool environment. -Dress appropriately. Encourage good hygiene. DEPRESSION; -Obtain emotional support or counseling as needed. -Dress attractively to increase self-esteem.

IS AWARE OF POSSIBLE MEDICAL TREATMENT:
Suppression of hormone production with medication (check medication classification for thyroid tissue with radioactive iodine. Surgical removal of part of the thyroid gland.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Thyroid storm or thyrotoxic crisis has a sudden onset with symptoms of high fever,  very rapid heart rate, delirium, dehydration, and extreme irritability. Prompt treatment is necessary because it can be life threatening. If untreated, thyroid disease can cause elevated cholesterol levels, heart disease, infertility, and osteoporosis."
TEACHING GUIDES (Ileostomy Care),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: 
Is a surgical opening between the ileum and the abdominal wall. A small portion of the intestine es sewed to the surface of the abdomen to crate a ""stoma"". The purpose of an ileostomy is to bypass a diseased colon and rid the body of wastes. The small intestine is approximately 18 feet long and is divided into three sections. The ileum is the last section of the small intestine and is connected to the large intestine at the ileocecal valve. Digestive enzymes are secreted and fluid is absorbed in the small intestine.

EMPTYING A POUCH:
Empty when one third full. Sit on toilet or place on chair with the pouch opening placed in the toilet. Put toilet paper on the surface of the toilet water to avoid splashing. Remove clamp and let contents empty into toilet. Squeeze the remaining contests out of the pouch. While holding up the end of the pouch, pour a cup of water into pouch, swish, and empty. Do not get the stoma or adhesive seal wet. Use toilet paper to clean around opening of pouch and clamp pouch shut.

PROCEDURE OF CHANGING THE POUCHING SYSTEM:
Change pouch every 5 to 7 days or as needed. Assemble all of the equipment. Hold skin taut, and peel off the pouch being worn. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water, rise, and par dry. Inspect the stoma for any change in size or color. Inspect the skin for signs of irritation and apply  skin barrier. Apply pouch over the stoma.

DIETARY MEASURES:
Chew food slowly and completely for better digestion. Drink at least six to eight glasses of fluids per day. Avoid foods that may cause blockage such as celery, corn, lettuce, popcorn, nuts coleslaw, and seeds. Decrease fiber in diet if stools are excessively loose. Limit or avoid foods such as eggs, fish, onions, and cabbage, which can increase odor. Eat foods such as spinach, parsley, yogurt, or buttermilk, which can decrease odor.

MEASURES FOR MANAGEMENTS:
Avoid laxatives, enteric-coated pills, and timed-release pills. Avoid stress and smoking. Assess for skin irritation caused by enzymes in stools, and provide skin care. Avoid contact sports and weight lifting. Avoid tight, constrictive clothing. Keep extra ileostomy supplies on hand. Wear a Medic Alert bracelet. Report to physician any signs of bleeding, persistent diarrhea, change in size or color of stoma, and continued skin irritation.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Dehydration, Bowel obstruction, Electrolyte imbalance.
"
TEACHING GUIDES (Inflammtory Bowel Diseases) Ulcerative Colitis/Crohn's,"EXPLAIN THE DISEASE PROCESS OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS ANS CROHN'S DISEASE:
Both are inflammatory bowel diseases. Both are chronic disorders. The damaged created in both diseased is the result of inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract. When damaged, the intestine secretes large amounts of water and sodium. This results in the inability to absorb excess fluid and diarrhea occurs. Crohn's disease can occur anywhere in the digestive tract. It causes damage deep in the layers of tissue. Ulcerative colitis usually affects only the inner lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum.

RISK FACTORS:
Age-most likely to develop between ages of 15 and 35 years. Race: -Whites have the highest risk. -Jewish or of European descent have four to five times the risk of Crohn's disease. Family history of this disease. Where you live, as living in urban areas of an industrialized country or in Norther climates increases risk. Stress, which will increase the risk.

SYMPTOMS OF INFLAMMATORY DISEASES:
Diarrhea, ranging from looser or more frequent stools to dozens of bowel movements a day. Abdominal pain and cramping(in more severe cases, pain can be severe and accompany nausea and vomiting). Blood in the stool. Ulcers of the intestine that may progress and penetrate the intestinal wall. Reduced appetite and weight loss. Fever and fatigue.  

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Obstruction of the bowel. Ulcers of digestive tract. Fistulas in the wall of digestive tract. Anal fissure. Malnutrition. Colon cancer. Crohn's disease can even cause other problems: -Arthritis. -Inflammation of eyes or skin. -Kidney stones. -Gallstones. -Osteoporosis. Depression and social isolation.

MEASURES TO MANAGE AND COPE WITH THESE DISEASES:
Diet-certain foods and beverages will aggravate symptoms: -Limit dairy products (lactose diet in therapeutic diets). -Try low-fat foods. Avoid butter, margarine, peanut butter, nuts, mayonnaise, avocados, cream, ice cream, fried foods, and chocolate and limit red meat. Experiment with amount of fiber in diet to evaluate tolerance. -Try various ways to prepare fruits and vegetable. They may be better tolerated steamed, baked, or stewed. Problem foods may be cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, apples, or carrots. Avoid other foods that make symptoms worse, such as citrus fruits, spicy food, popcorn, caffeine, and chocolate. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. -Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, or carbonated drink. -Consult with dietician. 

Avoid stress when possible. To help cope with stress, try some relaxation techniques, including the following: -Mild exercise. -Biofeedback. -Yoga or massage. -Deep breathing and relaxation exercises. -Set  aside time each day for relaxing activity. Be Informed about disease. Any situation is easier to handle when the facts are known.  Make contacts with support groups. Seek health care professionals for information and emotional support."
TEACHING GUIDES (Insulin Teaching guide),"STATE ACTION OF INSULIN:
Helps to control blood-sugar levels in clients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is administered by insulin subcutaneous injection or insulin pump. Types of insulin are: -Humalog, Novolog (very short acting). the onset of action is 5 to 15 minutes, and the peak effect is after 30 to 60 minutes. -Regular (short acting). The onset of action is 30 minutes. The peak effect is after 2 to 5 hours. -HPH (intermediate acting). The onset of action in 1 to 2.5 hours. The peak effect is after 8 to 14 hours. -Lente (intermediate acting) The onset of action is 1 to 2.5 hours. the peak effect is after 8 to 12 hours. -Ultra lente (long acting). The peak effect is after 10 to 18 hours. -Premixed combinations have the onset of action in 30 minutes. The peak effect is after 7 to 12 hours. Examples of combinations are 70/30 (70 intermediate/30 rapid acting). 50/50 (50 intermediate/50 rapid acting), and 75/25 (75 intermediate/25 rapid acting. -Lantus (insulin glargine). It has a constant long duration with no defined peak of action. It is usually given once a day and usually at bedtime.

POSSIBLE ADVERSE REACTIONS TO INSULIN:
Hypoglycemia or low blood sugar: Headache. -Sweating. -Hunger. -Nervousness. -Weakness. -Restlessness or sweating during sleep. Hyperglycemia or high blood sugar: -Flushed. -Dry skin. -Nausea. -Fatigue. -Headache. -Dizziness. Allergic reaction (seek emergency treatment).

PRECAUTIONS WHEN STORING, PREPARING, AND ADMINISTERING INSULIN:
Keep insulin vials that are currently in use at room temperature. When no needed, store in refrigerator. Never freeze insulin. Take insulin exactly as prescribed, and never adjust dose without orders from physician. Do not interchange beef, pork, or human insulin's. Lantus insulin should never be mixed with other insulin's. Never use insulin that has changed color or consistency. Rotate sites to prevent skin complications using abdomen, upper and outer thighs, upper arms, and buttocks. Administer insulin promptly (within 5 minutes) after mixing insulin's. Use only insulin syringes to administer insulin. Press-do no massage injection site after administration of insulin. Dispose of syringes in an impermeable container. 


OTHER PRECAUTIONS WHEN TAKING INSULIN:
Limit cigarette smoking because it decreases the amount of insulin absorbed when given subcutaneously. Avoid alcohol and aspirin, which may increase affect of insulin. Never omit meals. Carry a snack (source of simple sugar) at all times in case of low blood sugar. Wear a medical identification bracelet. Monitor and record blood or urine glucose levels. monitor factors that affect amount of insulin required: Follow diet closely as instructed. Exercise daily in constant amounts. Use stress management techniques. Obtain prompt treatment for any infections. Test blood sugar more frequently if a change in diet, activity, stress, illness, or infection occurs, and notify the physician.
Keep follow-up appointments with the physician and laboratory. Report any signs of hypoglycemia, that is, headache, sweating, hunger, nervousness, and weakness. Report any signs of hyperglycemia, That is, flushed, dry skin; nausea; fatigue; headache; and dizziness.

MEASURES TO SAFELY USE INSULIN PUMP:
The insulin pump is used for continuous (24 hour) insulin delivery. The insulin pump has a pump reservoir and a computer chip that allows the user to control the exact amount of insulin being delivered and is battery operated. They are approximately the size of a beeper. It is attached to a thin plastic tube that has a soft cannula or needle at the end to deliver insulin. The cannula (needle) is inserted under the skin, usually on the abdomen. It needs to be changed every 3 days. The tubing can be disconnected when showering or swimming.

DEMONSTRATE SYRNGE PREPARATION:
Wash hands thoroughly. Assemble equipment: syringe, insulin, alcohol swab. Check that you are using appropriate type of insulin and that it has not expired. Verify that you are using appropriate type of syringe (only insulin syringe). Roll the insulin bottle gently to mix it. Cleanse top of bottle with alcohol. Pull plunger of syringe back the number units of insulin to be injected, not allowing the needle to touch anything. Insert the needle into the bottle and inject air. Invert the bottle and syringe, and slowly withdraw prescribed amount of insulin, being sere that the needle is under the fluid level. Check the syringe for air bubbles, and remove by tapping the syringe. Draw up more insulin, and discard excess if necessary for accurate amount.

DEMONSTRATE PROCEDURE FOR INSULIN INJECTION:
Wash hands. Check previous rotation site and select new site. Prepare the injection site by swabbing the center of the area with alcohol and moving outward in a circular manner about 2 inches. Allow the area to air dry. Pinch the skin approximately 2 inches with thumb and forefinger at the injection site, not touching the area that was cleaned."
TEACHING GUIDES (Insulin Teaching guide) continued,"DEMONSTRATE PROCEDUTE FOR INSULIN INJECTION:
Inject the needle into the skin using a quick, firm motion at a 24-degree (normal weight) or 90-degree angle (obese patient). Inject insulin slowly into the tissue. Remove the needle, and hold swab over site briefly. Place the manufacturer's needle guard to cover needle and dispose syringe/needle in safety container.

LIST SITES OF BODY FOR INSULIN INJECTIONS:
Upper arms. Abdomen. Thighs. Buttocks."
TEACHING GUIDES (Latex Allergy),"DEFINE LATEX ALLERGY:
Latex sensitivity is an allergic response to the protein in latex. latex gloves are often coated with powder that gives the latex particles the ability to become airborne. Latex allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe.

TWO TYPES OF ALLERGIC REACTION TO LATEX:
Contact dermatitis is usually a delayed localized skin reaction that occurs within 6 to 8 hours of contact and can last several days. The most common place of reaction is the hands. Immediate hypersensitivity is an instant system reaction of swelling, itching, respiratory distress, hypotension, and even death. General symptoms of latex allergy can be as follows: -Itchy, red, or watery eyes. -Sneezing or runny nose. -Coughing. -rash or hives. -Chest tightness and shortness of breath. -Shock.

TEACHING GUIDES (Liver Cirrhosis),"HAS A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LIVER:
The liver is the larges organ of the body and is located in the upper right part of the abdominal cavity. The liver has multiple functions: -It produces bile, which aids digestion in the intestines. -It stores vitamins A, D, E, K, and B12. It stores glycogen releasing it as glucose when needed. -It metabolizes fats, carbohydrates, and protein. -It metabolizes estrogen. It is very important in the coagulation (blood clotting) process. It destroys old, red blood cells and removes bacteria and foreign bodies from the blood stream.

DEFINE CIRRHOSIS:
It is the result of chronic liver disease that causes death of liver cells. The death of cells es replaced by scar tissue and results in liver dysfunction. 

IS AWARE OF CAUSES OF CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE:
Long-term alcohol abuse (primary cause). Drug and substance abuse. A  history of biliary obstruction and infection. Viral hepatitis infections. Exposure to chemical and industrial toxins. Metabolic disorders such as hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease.

Monitor ammonia levels. -Adjust texture of food if mouth or esophagus bleeding. -Take vitamin supplements (especially B vitamins) as ordered. -Sodium and fluids may be restricted by physician to control edema. Avoid contact with people who are ill to avoid infections and report any early signs of infection. Report signs of bleeding and minimize possibility of trauma. Avoid forceful nose blowing, avoid straining at stool, use sort toothbrush, and so forth. Report changes to physician such as any increased edema, fever, rapid weight loss, bleeding of any kind, confusion, personality change, and increased abdominal girth. Take medications as prescribed ans assess for side effects (decreased metabolism increases the risk for toxicity). Keep follow-up appointments with the physician. Use a Medical Alert bracelet or card.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Bleeding esophageal var ices. Portal hypertension. Hepatic encephalopathy. Kidney failure. -Ascites. Hepatic coma. Mental confusion. Liver cancer. Sepsis."
TEACHING GUIDES (Lung Cancer),"SOME GENERAL FACTS ABOUT LUNG CANCER:
Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer. Ninety percent of lung cancer patients are smokers. Early lung cancer may have no signs of symptoms. Prognosis improves with early detection.

TWO MAIN TYPES OF LUNG CANCER:
Small cell lung cancer spreads early and occurs mostly in smokers. It occurs in 10% to 25% of lung rumors. Non-small cell lung cancer is more common (accounts for more than 75% of lung cancers). There are four categories of non-small cell lung cancer: -Squamous cell carcinoma forms in cells lining the airways. It is the most common type of cancer in men. -Adenocarcinoma usually begins in the mucous-producing cells. It is the most common type of lung cancer seen in women and in people who have never smoked. -Large cell carcinoma originates in the peripheral parts of the lungs. -Bronchoalveolar carcinoma is an uncommon type of cancer and it tends to grow more slowly.

RISK FACTORS:
Smoking is the grates risk factor. Current or former women smokers have a greater  risk. Risk increases with exposure to secondhand smoke. Risk increases with exposure to asbestos, radioactive dust, arsenic, and plastics. Black Americans have a higher risk of lung cancer. Hereditary factors increase the risk.

S/SX:
Persistent cough (smoker's cough). Blood in sputum. New onset of wheezing in the chest . Chest pain. Fever. Weight loss. Repeated episodes of pneumonia or bronchitis. Shortness of breath. Hoarseness that last more than 2 weeks. Arm and shoulder pain.

MEASURES FOR PREVENTION OF LUNG CANCER:
Do not smoke. Quitting can reduce the risk. Avoid secondhand smoke. Test your home for radon. Avoid carcinogens such as vinyl chloride, nickel chromates, and coal products. Eat a healthy diet that includes five to six  servings of fruits and vegetables. Have routine health care and report any early signs and symptoms.

POSSIBLE TRATMENTS OF LUNG CANCER:
Treatments depend on the type and stage of cancer. Also, your overall health is a factor to  consider when planning treatment. Small cell lung cancer has usually spread to other organs by the time it is diagnosed. Surgery is not a treatment option in most cases. Chemotherapy and radiation are used. Surgery is usually the treatment for early stage non-small cell lung cancer. Operations used are: -Wedge resection removes the section with tumor. -Lobectomy involves removing and entire lobe of one lung. -Pneumonectomy is when ans entire lung is removed.

MEASURES FOR MANAGEMENT FO DISEASE:
Increase fluid intake to liquefy secretions. Nutritional measures: -Eat a diet that is high in protein and calories. -Eat small, frequent meals rather than three large ones. -Suggest easily digested foods such as soups or broth, rice, toast, baked potatoes, and so forth. -Avoid rich or spicy foods. Do not smoke and avoid secondhand smoke. Regular exercise balanced with adequate rest. Report weight loss, increased coughing, pain, fatigue, or blood in sputum to physician. Reduce stress. Keep follow-up appointments with physician.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:

Is the cluster of metabolic risk factors that increase the risk of coronary artery disease. The American Heart Association and the National Heart, lung and Blood Institute suggest the following perimeters for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. They include the following: -Obesity, including a wist circumference more than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women. -Blood pressure of 130/85mm Hg or higher. -Triglyceride level of 150mg/dl or higher. HDL level below 40 mg/dl in men and 50 mg/dl in women. Fasting serum glucose level of 100 mg/dl.

OBJETIVE METHODS USED TO EVALUATE FOR THIS SYNDROME DURING A PHYSICAL EXMINATION:
BMI is the body mass index, which compare a person's weight to their height to give an estimate of body fat. Waist circumference is a reflection of body fat distribution. Fat that is distributed in large amounts around the waist is often called an apple-shaped body type. This body type is at the greatest risk for cardiovascular disease. Skin-fold measurements are usually taken at the triceps, and biceps areas. This also helps to establish the body fat percentage of an individual. Measure blood pressure and pulse. Assess for shortness of breath and/or edema.

LABORATORY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THE PHYSICIAN MAY USE TO EVALUATE FOR THE PRESENCE :
Total cholesterol and LDL and HDL levels. Serum triglycerides. Blood glucose level.

ADDITIONAL TESTING THE PHYSICIAN MAY USE TO EVALUATE FOR DAMAGE TO THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:
Electrocardiogram (ECG). stress test. Echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization. Chest x-ray.

RESOURCES INCLEDED IN THIS BOOK FOR THE METABOLIC SYNDROME:

TEACHING GUIDES (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus) (MRSA),"DEFINE MSRA:
MRSA is an infection caused by staphylococcus aureus bacteria or ""staph."" It was one of the first infections to prove resistant to the broad-spectrum antibiotics. Staph infections are seen mostly in hospitals or health care facilities. They are hospital-acquired infections. The infection can also be acquired in a community setting. Staph can enter the body via a cut or wound. Unfortunately, the client with ans impaired immune system or the older client can have a more serious infection. Vancomycin is currently effective against MRSA.

S/SX:
Staph infections usually start as red bumps that resemble pimples, boils, or spider bite. They can evolve into deep, painful abscesses that require surgical intervention. They can also cause infections in bones, joints, surgical wounds, bloodstream, heart valves and lungs.

TEACHING GUIDES (Reduced-Fat  Diets),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
Fats provide energy, help in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, supply fatty acids, lubricate body tissues, help regulate temperature, and provide protection for some of the most vital organs in our bodies. A healthy level of dietary fat also gives flavor to our foods and provides a feeling of fullness during meal intake. High levels of fat contribute to many chronic diseases. high-fat diets greatly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and some types of  cancer.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A REDUCED-FAT DIET:
The American Heart Association, Surgeon General, American Cancer Society, and the American Diabetes Association agree on the following: -Have diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and moderate in total fat. -limit fat 35% or less of the total daily calorie intake. -Limit saturated fat to less than 10% of total daily calorie intake. -Limit cholesterol to 300 mg or less daily.

Beef, butter (or margarine), salad dressings (including mayonnaise), cheese, and milk are the top five sources of saturated fat in the average diet.

REDUCE DIETARY FAT IN THE DIET:
Fruits-avoid avocado, coconut, and olives. Most other fruits are low in fat. Vegetables-eat and prepare vegetables wisely. Avoid fried, creamed vegetables.  Avoid cheese and dressings high in fat on vegetables. Dairy products-select low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt, and cheese products. Drink two to three servings of low-fat milk and milk products daily. Proteins -Use plant sources of protein such as beans and nuts. -Use lean meats and trim any excess fat. -Remove skin from poultry. Avoid breading or sauces. -Limit intake of organ meats like liver. -Limit shellfish (crab, lobster, etc.) due to high cholesterol levels. Read nutrition fact labels carefully when shopping. - Use lo-fat or fat-free salad dressings. -Choose vegetable oils lower in saturated fats such as canola oil.  -Season foods with lemon juice, or spices and herbs with label of low fat/low sodium. Cooking and serving foods. -Use fats and oils sparingly when cooking or serving foods. _use low-fat sauces on rice, pasta, and potatoes. -If using some of ht commercial fat replacers, be alert for gastrointestinal side effects (cramps and diarrhea).

It is a systemic inflammatory disorder of connective tissue and joints. It is a chronic disease characterized by remissions and exacerbation. The cause of this disease is unknown, but it is considered an autoimmune disease. Ra affects small joints. Ra strikes most often between the ages of 20 to 40 years of ages, but it can also be found in children and older adults.

S/SX:
Localized symptoms are joint pain, swelling, warmth, redness (erythema), stiffness, limited mobility of affected joints, and fluid on joints. The swelling and pain can come and go. Stiffness can occur, particularly in the morning and when sitting for long periods of time. Joints are usually affected bilaterally and symmetrically. Fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, depression, and weight loss can occur. Flu-like symptoms are possible, including a low-grade fever. Anemia is possible. Decreased tolerance to stress can occur.

MEASURES TO MANAGE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS:
Adequate exercise: -Always get physician's approval for level of exercise. -Regular exercise includes: -Flexibility (stretching, range of motion). -Strengthening (resistance). -Cardiovascular (aerobic). -Exercise at a slow steady pace. -Perform active or passive range of motion exercises. -Never exercise a hot, inflamed joint. -Balance exercise with rest. -Set realistic goals. -Stop exercise or activity if pain occurs. Proper diet: -Maintain healthy weight to decrease pressure on joints. -Eat well-balanced meals that are high in protein, vitamins, zinc, and iron to promote tissue building and repair. Stress management skills. Pain control: -Apply heat or cold as ordered. Apply splints as ordered. Use transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation as ordered. Take pain medications as ordered. Consider other alternatives, such as biofeedback, relaxation techniques, Tai Chi exercise, and pain clinics. Avoid extremes intemperature and damp, moist evironments. Physical or occupational therapy referrals. Assistive, adaptive, or protective devices (braces, splints, etc.)"
TEACHING GUIDES (Sjogren's Syndrome),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
The white blood cells incorrectly produce antibodies which attack, inflame, and damage moisture producing glands. Damage is most common to the tear and saliva glands.

RISK FACTORS:
Greater for women. Greater over the age of 40 years. Higher for people who have rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, polymyositis, Raynaud's, and scleroderma or those who have family history of rheumatic disease. The more serious form is called primary Sjogren's. Damage is done to the moisture producing tissue in the skin, muscle, joints, thyroid, blood vessels, liver, or pancreas.

SYMPTOMS OF SJOGREN'S SINDROME:
Thee or more month history of a dry or gritty eyes sensation, blurred vision, or bright-light sensitivity. Chronic complaints of dry or ""cotton"" mouth often combined with thickened saliva that becomes sticky. Decreased saliva  will: -Increase the risk of cavities. Cause lips to crock and bleed. -Cause mouth sores and fugal infections. -Make taste and smell abilities fade. Damaged moisture production in other areas can cause: - Dry and itchy skin rashes. -Joint pain. -Gastrointestinal problems. -Heartburn. -Weight loss. -Thyroid problems. -Lung and respiratory problems.

TREATMENT FOR SJOGREN'S SYNDROME:
The goal is to moisturize and protect any problem areas. Treatment for the mouth: -Regular dental care. -Sugar-free hard candy or gum. -Good oral care using fluoride gel, floss and rinses. -Over-the-counter artificial saliva products. -No smoking. -Use of humidifiers in home. Treatment for the eyes: -Avoid wind, sand, and smoke. Goggles can be ,used as protection. -Artificial tears can be helpful. Treatment for skin: -Moisturizing soaps. -Oil-based ointments. -Protection against sunlight. -Vaginal lubricants. Use medication only as directed by physician. Because various medical specialist and health provides are involved, coordinate and inform all care provider to maximize treatment."
TEACHING GUIDES (Skin Cancer),"STATE GENERAL FACTS ABOUT SKIN CANCER:
Skin cancer usually develops on skin exposed to the sun, but it can also develop on areas of the skin not ordinarily exposed to sunlight. It is the most common form of cancer. Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer. Prevention or early detection is essential. One in seven Americans will develop skin cancer each year. More than 1 million new cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed in the United States this year.

FACTORS THAT INCREASE RISK OF SKIN CANCER:
Fair skin. History of sunburn. excessive sun exposure. Living in sunny or high-altitude climates. Large number of moles or abnormal moles. Precancerous skin lesion (most common on face, lower arms, and hands of fair-skinned people. Family or personal history of skin cancer. People with a weakened immune system or skin that has been burned or injured. Exposure to environmental hazards, chemical, or herbicides. Advanced age.

THREE MAIN TYPES OF SKIN CANCER:
Basal cell is the most common type of skin cancer and is the easily treated if found early. Melanoma is the most serious. It can develop in normal skin or in an existing mole. It accounts for only 4% of the cases of skin cancer but is the cause of 75% of skin cancer deaths.

USE THE A-B-C-D SKIN SELF-EXAM GUIDE FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY TO DETECT SKIN CANCERS:
A is for asymmetrical shape. Note any moles with irregular shapes or that do not match on each side. B is for irregular border. Note any moles that have a notched, scalloped, or indistinct border. C is for change in color. Note any moles that are unusually dark or have variegated or uneven colors. D is for diameter. Note any moles that are larger than one-quarter inch in size or the size of a pencil erase.

LIST SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF THE THREE TYPES OF SKIN CANCER:
Basal cell carcinoma (cancer) symptoms are: -A  pearly or waxy bump on the face, ears, or neck. -A flat, flesh colored or brown scar-like lesion on your chest or back.  Squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) symptoms are : -A firm, red nodule on your face, lips, ears, neck hands, or arms. -A flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface on the face, ears , neck, hands, or arms. Melanoma symptoms are: -A large brownish spot with darker speckles located anywhere on your body. -A simple mole located anywhere on your body that changes in color, size, or feel or that bleeds. -A lesion with an irregular border and red, white, blue, or blue,black spots. -A shiny, firm dome-shaped bump located anywhere on your body. -Dark lesion, on your palm, sloe, fingertips, or toes. -Dark lesions on mucous membranes, lining your mouth, nose, vagina, vulva, or anus.

MEASURES TO PREVENT SKIN CANCER:
Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Wear sunscreen: -Use year round. -Sunscreen with protection factor of at least 15 is recommended. -Do not miss use of sunscreen on lips, ears, and back of hands and neck and tops of feet. -Apply sunscreen 20 to 30 minutes before exposure, and reapply every 2 hours of after swimming or exercising. -Check with the Food and Drug Administration for list of currently approved sunscreen products. Wear protective clothing including broad brimmed hat, sunglasses, and so forth. Avoid tanning beds. Be alert to medications that can make our skin more sensitive to sunlight. Routine self skin checks should include (using a mirror if necessary): -Check face, neck, ears, and scalp. -Examine both front and back of legs and feet (even between toes). -Check tops and undersides of arms and hands. -Examine chest and trunk of body. Check genital areas. If you are older than 40 or have a high risk of developing skin cancer, consult your physician for annual skin exams.
"
TEACHING GUIDES (Sodium-Restricted Diets),"EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF SODIUM:
Most dietary sodium is added to foods during cooking and processing. Sodium es absorbed by the intestines and excreted primarily by the kidneys. Increased levels of sodium in the body promote water retention and swelling.

SODIUM INTAKE AND SODIUM RETENTION:
Sodium is monitored to evaluate fluid electrolyte balance of the body. Cardiovascular disease and kidney disease will affect the body's use of sodium. Sodium level testing is also used to monitor effects of diuretic drug therapy. Diuretics are frequently used in treatment of Hypertension.

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IN A SODIUM-RESTRICTED DIET:
One teaspoon of table/cooking salt contains 2300 mg of sodium. The recommended amount of sodium for a healthy adult not on any sodium restrictions is 2400 mg of sodium daily. Restricted-sodium diets are often classified as: -No added salt-usually recognized as a 4-g sodium diet. -A low-sodium or restricted-sodium diet is usually a 2-g sodium (2-g Na) or 1-g sodium (1-g Na). Unseen sodium is in: -Over-the-counter medications such as antacids and laxatives. -Commercial beverage and bottled drinking water. -Toothpaste and  mouthwash-do not swallow. -Processed foods, which yield the largest amount of sodium.

WAYS TO REDUCE DIETARY SODIUM INTAKE:
Read labels. Sodium will be listed as amount and as percentage. Use food products with reduced sodium or no added salt. Use herbs, spices, lemon juice, and so forth instead of salt when cooking. Rinse foods such as tuna to remove some of the sodium. Remove salt from table, and avoid adding salt to prepared food. Avoid condiments such as sou and teriyaki sauce and monosodium glutamate. Limit the usual condiments, such as mustard and ketchup. Eat fresh foods rather than canned or convenience foods. Limit cured foods such as bacon , ham, and hot dogs. Avoid foods packed in brine or pickled, such as sauerkraut, olives , and pickles. Before using a ""salt substitute,"" check with physician because many of these products have potassium instead of sodium. Salt substitutes are only for use at the table. If cooked, they may taste bitter. Use unsalted butter or margarine. Use low-sodium luncheon meats, cheeses, and peanut butter. Avoid organ meats, clams, lobster, crab, oysters, scallops, shrimp, and other shellfish. Read labels on ready-to-serve or convenience foods for sodium content. Information about the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet can be obtained at www.dash.bwh.harvard.edu. This diet plan promotes a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods and the use of fewer snack and sugars."
TEACHING GUIDES (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
With SLP the body's immune system does not function as it should. It produces antibodies that fight against the body's healthy cells and tissue. It is a chronic disorder with exacerbation's and remissions. It is an inflammatory disorder that causes structural changes in connective tissue affecting the skin, joints, muscles, and other organs. Symptoms may range from mild to severe. Symptoms may vary during the course of the disease.

The following list shows foods to use in small amounts: Organ meats, anchovies, consomme, gravies, lentils, whole-grain cereals, beans, peas, asparagus, cauliflower, mushrooms spinach, butter, cola, yeast. Increase fluids (water is best) to at least 2.5 quarts per day. Increased activity to decrease urinary stasis: -Use active or passive range of motion exercises. -Change positions frequently. Strain all urine to secure a stone if it passes. Take pain medications as ordered. Take the full course of antibiotics. Consult physician before taking any over-the-counter medications. avoid alcohol. Urine cultures should be taken periodically as a follow-up to detect any recurrent infections. Report to physician signs of restlessness, flank pain, decreased urine output, and fever, or go to the emergency room if the pain is severe. Keep follow-up appointments with physician.

POSIBLE COMPLICATION:
Urinary tract infection. Urinary obstruction. Renal failure. Pyelonephritis. Kidney damage and scarring.
"
TEACHING GUIDES (Urinary Tract Infection) (Cystitis) (Lower Urinary Tract Infection),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is an infection of the bladder or urethra frequently caused by bacteria. It is more common in women than men. It can become a chronic problem.

RISK FACTORS:
Females. Advancing age. Obstruction (enlarged prostate, calculi, etc.) Pregnancy. Poor personal hygiene. Use of catheters. Sexual intercourse.

S/SX:
Burning sensation when urinating . Strong, persistent urge to urinate. Passing frequent, small amounts of urine. Low back pain or feeling of pressure in lower abdomen. Cloudy or strong-smelling urine. Fever.

MEASURES TO PREVENT:
Void frequently to empty bladder completely. Always wipe from front to back. Wear cotton underpants and nonrestrictive clothing. Urinate before and after sexual intercourse.
 Avoid use of feminine sprays and bubble baths. Keep perineal area very clean. Avoid delaying the urge to urinate. Drink fluid intake of 2 to 3 liters per day if not contraindicated. Eat a well-balanced diet. -Avoid coffee, alcohol, and soft drinks with caffeine, citrus juices, and spicy foods until infection has cleared. -Physician may recommend the use of vitamin C supplements. - Studies have shown cranberry juice to inhibit growth of E. coli. Check with physician before using cranberry juice. Cranberry juice may have a negative interaction with the medication Coumadin. Take antibiotics until completed. Report early signs and symptoms of infection to the physician. Take medications as instructed. Shower instead of bathing to decrease possibility of bacteria entrance. Exercise regularly to prevent urinary stasis. Keep follow-up appointments with physician and laboratory.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Recurrent infections. Infections of kidney or ureters."
TEACHING GUIDES (Varicose Veins),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
Arteries carry blood away from the heart while veins carry blood to the heart. Veins have a series of valves that allow blood to be carried against gravity and prevent a back flow of blood. Varicose veins are abnormally dilated veins that may twist and turn. They are caused by valves in the veins that stretch and weaken, causing blood to pool in the lower extremities. Varicose veins can occur in legs, esophagus, or rectal area.

RISK FACTORS:
Congenital weakness of vein structure. Obesity. Pregnancy. Constrictive clothing. Prolonged periods of sitting. Venous obstruction (blood clots, tumors, etc.) Advanced age.

S/SX:
Enlarged, twisted veins that appear under the skin as dark blue or purple. Leg pain, especially after long periods of sitting. Swelling of feet, ankle, and legs. Complaint of legs feeling heavy or tired. Area with impaired circulation may appear darker than surrounding skin.

MEASURES TO PREVENT:
Avoid sitting or standing for long periods of time. Do not cross legs at the knee. Avoid injury to extremities. Avoid constrictive clothing. Have frequent rest periods with feet elevated. Exercise regularly such as swimming or walking. Wear elastic support hose. Demonstrate how to apply and remove support hose. Proper foot and nail care. Report any open areas. Lose weight if overweight (refer to weight reduction diet teaching guide). Avoid smoking(refer to tobacco abuse teaching guide.

TREATMENTS AVAILABLE IF THE ABOVE MEASURES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT:
Surgery includes vein ligation or vein stripping. Sclerotherapy uses a clotting solution, which is injected into vein, which closes it off. Endovenous ablation therapy uses laser energy to cauterize the  vein.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Superficial thrombophlebitis. Rupture. Venous stasis ulcers. Cellulitis.

"
TEACHING GUIDES (Venous Stasis Ulcer),"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
It is the breakdown of the skin caused by incompetent valves in the veins. Incompetent valves cause excessive venous pressure hath cause small skin veins and venules to rupture. Venous ulcers frequently occur on front of lower legs or around the ankle. They are slow to heal, prone to trauma, and may lead to secondary infection.

RISK FACTORS:
Thrombophlebitis. Varicose veins. Poor hygiene. Poor nutritional status. General debilitation.

S/SX:
Thickened leathery skin. Reddish brown skin discoloration. Swelling of extremity. Pain (relieved with elevation of foot).

MEASURES TO PREVENT:
Use elastic compression stockings. Have more than one pair of stockings so that one pair can be worn while the other pair is laundered. Apply stockings each morning before legs are lowered to floor. Eat a well-balanced diet high in protein, vitamin C zinc, and iron. Avoid heating pads, hot water bottles, and so forth. Elevate legs at regular periods for 15 to 20 minutes. Walk or do isometric calf muscle pumps frequently. Raise the foot of the bed to promote venous drainage during sleep. Wear shoes with laces to reduce pooling of blood in the feet. Avoid poorly fitting shoes and sandals to avoid injury. Avoid morning showers or sitting in front of a fire because the heat dilates the blood vessels and may add to congestion and swelling. Avoid extreme temperatures. Avoid nicotine and caffeine.

TREATMENT AS ORDERED BY PHYSICIAN:
Provide dressing changes of wound as ordered by physician using aseptic technique. Avoid tape directly on skin. Application of Unna boots. Chronic non-healing ulcers may be treated with topical hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Vascular surgery for repair or debridement of wound. Pain medication as directed.

POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS:
Infection. Re-occurrence of venous stasis ulcer. Amputation o extremity. Cellulitis.

"
TEACHING GUIDES (West Nile Virus),"WEST NILE VIRUS (WNV), ITS SYMPTOMS, AND ITS METHOD OF TRANSMISSION:
It is an infectious disease spread by infected mosquitoes. People infected with WNV usually have mild or no symptoms. Symptoms that may appear are as follows: -Fever. Headache. Body aches. -Skin rash. -Swollen lymph glands. Complications of WNV occur if the infection spreads to the brain and causes inflammation resulting in encephalitis or meningitis. WNV primarily circulates between infected birds and mosquitoes that  bite them. The infected mosquitoes can the bite and infect other animals and humans.

WAYS TO PREVENT WNV:
Prevent mosquito bites by: -Using insect repellent. -Wearing loose-fitting clothing that covers the legs and arms. -Cleaning clogged rain gutters to avoid standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs. -Emptying water once or twice a week dishes, birdbaths, swimming pool covers, and any other items that cam collect water. -Staying indoors between dusk and dawn (when mosquitoes are most active).

NEW WARNINGS REGARDING THE SPREAD OF WNV:
In 2002, the Centers for Disease control and Prevention, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and other government agencies confirmed the spread of WNV by infected blood and/or organ transplantation. Blood blanks will ask potential blood donors whether they have had a fever and headache during the previous week. The donor will no be allowed to give blood donations at that time."
TEACHING GUIEDES (Sickle Cell Anemia),"DEFINE SICKLE CELL ANEMIA:
The red blood cells, normally disc shaped, become crescent shaped. They do not function correctly and can cause small blood clots. This can result in sickle cell pain crisis. It is an inherited disease. Genetic counseling is recommended for all carriers of sickle cell disease. It is much more common in Africans. One in 12 African Americans have a sickle cell trait.

SYMPTOMS OF SICKLE CELL ANEMIA:
They are: -Yellow eyes/skin and/or jaundice. -Paleness. -Fatigue. -Breathlessness. -Rapid heart rate. -Delayed growth and puberty. -Greater susceptibility to infections. -Ulcers on lower legs (adolescents and adults). Bone pain. -Fever. -Attacks of abdominal; pain. They may also have: -Bloody urine. Frequent urination. -Excessive thirst. -Chest pain. -Poor eyesight/blindness.

DEFINE AND LIST SYMPTOMS FO SICKLE CELL PAIN CRISIS:
Sickle cell disease is present at birth. Symptoms usually do not occur until after 4 months of age. The malformed cells can block blood vessels and damage organs, resulting ""crisis"". This can be life threatening. The three types of  ""crisis"" are as fallows: -Hemolytic crisis (damaged red blood cells break down). Splenic sequestration crisis (spleen enlarges and traps blood cells). Aplastic crisis (infection causes bone marrow to stop producing red blood cells. These painful crises can last from hours to days. Some episodes can require hospitalization for hydration and pain control. Pain is in bones of back, chest, and long bones (such as femur or things). 

DEFINE COMPLICATIONS OF UNTREATED SICKLE CELL DISEASE:
Complication of untreated or poorly managed sickle cell disease can result in: -Multi-system disease and failure (kidney, liver, lung, and spleen). -Recurrent crises resulting in severe anemia and gallstones. -Narcotic abuse. -Joint destruction. -Blindness/visual impairment. -Central nervous system (neuralgic symptoms and stroke). Infection, including pneumonia, cholecystitis (gallbladder), osteomyelitis (bone), and urinary tract infections.

TREATMENT MEASURES FOR SICKLE CELL ANEMIA/CRISIS:
Treatment and medical supervision should be ongoing. Folic acid supplements are used. During sickle crisis, pain control and adequate fluid intake are required. Antibiotics and vaccines are used to prevent bacteria infections. Psychosocial counseling is important. Strenuous physical activity, especially if the spleen is enlarged. -Emotional stress. -Environments with low oxygen content (high altitudes, etc.) Known sources of infection.
